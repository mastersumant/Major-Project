In the above-mentioned equation, the variables x and y can take any values such as integral
numbers (10, 20), real numbers (0.23, 5.5), or just 0 and 1. To solve the equation, we need to
relate them to the kind of values they can take, and data type is the name used in computer science
programming for this purpose. A data type in a programming language is a set of data with
predefined values. Examples of data types are: integer, floating point, unit number, character,
string, etc.
Computer memory is all filled with zeros and ones. If we have a problem and we want to code it,
itâ€™s very difficult to provide the solution in terms of zeros and ones. To help users, programming
languages and compilers provide us with data types. For example, integer takes 2 bytes (actual
value depends on compiler), float takes 4 bytes, etc. This says that in memory we are combining
2 bytes (16 bits) and calling it an integer. Similarly, combining 4 bytes (32 bits) and calling it a
float. A data type reduces the coding effort. At the top level, there are two types of data types:
