But on the days when she had to parch grain for Pandit
Udaybhan Pandey, the owner of the village, she went to bed hungry. People went to Panditji and asked him to
give the order for the old woman's oven to be rebuilt and the fire once more
lighted, but he paid no attention to them. He kicked at the trough again but she ran in front of it
and took the kick in her side. Bhungi was energetically rebuilding it with balls of clay Most
likely she had spent the night at this work and wanted to finish it before the sun
was high. 'If youâ€™re going to stay in the village you'll have to do my chores. She had to
keep stopping from the parching in order to keep the oven fire going. With this command the servants went away and Bhungi began to parch the
grain. Here she had
known the sorrows and pleasures of life; she could not give it up now in the
last days.
