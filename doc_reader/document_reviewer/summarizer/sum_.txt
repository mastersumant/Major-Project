Currently, the purpose of Artificial Intelligence is shared by all the different tools and techniques that we have invented over the past thousand years  to simplify human effort, and to help us make better decisions. It is the simulation of natural intelligence in machines that are programmed to learn and mimic the actions of humans. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence  which defines one of the core tenets of Artificial Intelligence  the ability to learn from experience, rather than just instructions. As all technology that has come before this, the research and development costs need to be subsidised by corporations and government agencies before it becomes accessible to everyday laymenAI is used in different domains to give insights into user behaviour and give recommendations based on the data. Artificial Intelligence has emerged to be the next big thing in the field of technology.
