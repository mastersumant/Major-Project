<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="5" wdcount="28"> The last time the Super Bowl was played there, in 1984, he felt as distant from all the hoopla as if he were 1,000 miles away, he recalls.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="6" wdcount="19"> Carley, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, had no interest in being inside the stadium .</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="10" wdcount="28"> Things are different; He says he only wished the black community could have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of America's greatest sports events.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="11" wdcount="10"> "The Super Bowl is about money," Carley said last week.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="12" wdcount="15"> "And last time we were basically onlookers."; Things are a lot different this time around.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="13" wdcount="30"> This year, Carley is the co-chairman of one of the featured events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, a Saturday extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="14" wdcount="16"> The grand marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneer.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="15" wdcount="16"> Other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a Doug Williams golf tournament.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="16" wdcount="31"> 'Much more involvement'; This year, the Super Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city's most influential white businessmen, named two black men to head a community-relations committee.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="17" wdcount="19"> But perhaps most important, Carley said, several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the NFL for the game.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="18" wdcount="20"> "There's much more involvement this time, black and white," said Carley, who is the affirmative-action officer for Hillsboro Community College.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="19" wdcount="5"> "There's been a heightened awareness.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="20" wdcount="42"> In 1984, there was not even a thought given to a black man."; About 100,000 visitors, many of them corporate and political movers and shakers, were expected to arrive in Tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game Sunday.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="21" wdcount="34"> The game itself, which is televised to 750 million people around the world, is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="22" wdcount="21"> Hotels, restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in revenues, with a total economic impact of $200 million.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="23" wdcount="27"> 'It's a bay window'; "The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way," said Barbara Casey, the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="24" wdcount="29"> "You don't have to say Tampa, Fla., anymore."; The Super Bowl also can highlight a community's problems, and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the surface.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="25" wdcount="18"> "It's more than a window into a town," said Jim Steeg, director of special events for the NFL.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="26" wdcount="40"> "It's a bay window."; Last month, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe, Ariz., because the state does not have a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="27" wdcount="44"> A week before the Super Bowl in Miami two years ago, the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an Hispanic police officer in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="28" wdcount="31"> While the disturbances were not caused by the Super Bowl, the NFL was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in the festivities.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="29" wdcount="13"> "I think Miami was the awakening for a lot of people," Carley said.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="30" wdcount="44"> In Tampa, Super Bowl XXV brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event in the city for 86 years: the Gasparilla Parade, an extravaganza that featured 500 of the city's most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed as gun-toting pirates.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="31" wdcount="16"> Tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the NFL for the Super Bowl.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="32" wdcount="34"> But after Tampa was awarded the 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over the parade, which always has been sponsored and organized by an all-white, all-male private club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="33" wdcount="21"> The club's top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents, including Carley, that the club be integrated immediately.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="34" wdcount="5"> Instead, they canceled the parade.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="35" wdcount="22"> The Super Bowl Task Force had to scramble to put together a new parade, and Carley became the co-chairman of that effort.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="36" wdcount="15"> SUPER BOWL XXVI; Super Bowl XXVI will be played Jan. 26, 1992, in the Metrodome.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="37" wdcount="10"> It will be Minneapolis' first time as the host city.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06025282" num="38" wdcount="27"> The last time the Super Bowl was held in a cold-climate city was in 1982, when the 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals 26-21 in Pontiac, Mich .</s>
