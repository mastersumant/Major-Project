Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, 47, will succeed his mentor, Margaret Thatcher, 
as Britain's prime minister. Major, a high-school dropout, was elected Conservative Party 
leader after Thatcher, failing to garner the necessary majority votes in a leadership 
contest last Tuesday, resigned. 

Though Major was two votes short of the required majority in yesterday's election, he 
was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers, former Defense 
Secretary Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Hurd, conceded defeat. 

The Labor Party, just recently a strong favorite in the next election, is now in second 
place behind a Tory party led by Major.</SUM>

John Major, 47, Margaret Thatcher's protege, was elected Conservative Party leader 
Tuesday night and will succeed her as prime minister. 

Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11 years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen 
Elizabeth II on Wednesday. Major would then be called to lead the government. 

His election climaxed a tumultuous month for the Conservative Party. The party trailed 
the Labor Party in the polls and lost a string of local Parliamentary elections. On Nov. 1, 
Deputy Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe resigned in a policy dispute over the 
European Community, calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interests.</SUM>

In four television interviews that began airing today, British Prime Minister John Major, 
said all Iraqi troops must withdraw from Kuwait or they will be "forcibly removed." 
Major arrived in Washington Thursday night for on a three-day visit to the U.S. He and 
President Bush will hold discussions this evening at Camp David in Maryland where they 
will spend the night.

Major's stance on Iraq was as unyielding as that of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, 
but unlike Mrs. Thatcher, he was polite to reporters questioning him. Comparing Major 
and Thatcher, one U.S. official said, "The biggest change is personal style."</SUM>

In a welcome to British Prime Minister John Major today at the Pittsburgh airport, 
President Clinton said the two nations were working together to end the conflict in 
Bosnia. Major, after visiting Pittsburgh where his father and grandfather once lived, will 
travel with the President back to Washington on Air Force One. On Tuesday, the two 
leaders will begin discussing a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, Northern 
Ireland, and world trade. 

Clinton and Major will meet again in June during D-Day 50th anniversary events in 
Europe. Major said Clinton would visit Britain, including possibly Oxford University,

Prime Minister John Major won the general election a year ago, but today he is a deeply 
unpopular, unproven leader. His party is internally torn over the controversy that 
accompanied Britain's withdrawal of sterling from the European Monetary System and 
by a lingering deep recession that has alienated many traditional supporters in business.

Most industrialists are grateful that he won the election and he is appreciated for personal 
qualities that are favorably compared to those of his predecessor. Unlike the former prime 
minister, however, he is viewed as a weak leader, with little vision and no clearly 
articulated political conviction.</SUM>

Some believe that the recording of John Major's conversation with Michael Brunson, 
ITN's political editor, in which Major used salty language will improve Major's image as 
a wimp. Not so. Major is gone, especially after the Christchurch by-election where a 
Conservative majority in last year's general election was transformed to a liberal 
Democrats majority of 16,427.

Actually, all politicians are far more candid when speaking privately. To demonstrate, I 
spoke yesterday with both Major and John Smith, Labor Party leader. Using a scrambler, 
to guarantee privacy, I provoked some frank discussion. The rambling responses of both 
were liberally sprinkled with expletives.</SUM>

On Easter Sunday, three Cabinet ministers supported John Major in the wake of 
speculation that he could be forced out this autumn. Both Secretary of State for Education 
John Patten and Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, dismissed talk of a leadership 
contest before the next general election. Lord Wakeham, Leader of the House of Lords, 
called on Torries to be loyal to Mr. Major.

One poll shows that Michael Heseltine is the favorite to replace Mr. Major if he is forced 
out, but that Michael Portillo will vigorously campaign to secure Eurosceptic policies 
from the eventual winner.</SUM>

In local elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat 
ever, losing 444 seats. They are now the third party nationally.

Some anti-John Major Conservatives are happy about the defeat. Propelled to power by 
Margaret Thatcher who expected to continue her program discretely, Major is a weak 
leader. Though some pushed him to pursue new "leftist" policies, Major vacillates to the 
left and to the right, producing a "crisis of honor."

He lacks vision, is incompetent on domestic and international issues, and is a political 
blunderer. The Tories will make him a scapegoat for their defeat at the polls.</SUM>

A biography of Mrs. Norma Major claims that the Majors' favorite film was "Being 
There," a movie about a vacuous gardener, Chauncey, who becomes a candidate for the 
U.S. presidency. I heartily concur with their choice. John Major must appreciate the 
similarities between himself and Chauncey. Like Chauncey whose bromides seem to 
convey whatever people want to believe they heard, Major is a chameleon. For the pro-
Europeans, he says he wants Britain to be at the heart of Europe, but before an audience 
of Euro-sceptics he freely insults the European Commission. He fits in with prevailing 
circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.</SUM>
