On Tuesday, within hours after a gunman opened fire at Cleveland Elementary School in 
Stockton, CA, killing five children and himself and wounding 30 others, 25 translators 
who spoke Southeast Asian languages rushed to the school and hospitals to assist non-
English-speaking parents. One hospital called for help because its staff with language 
skills was overloaded. Translators were located and sent by the Charterhouse Center 
refugee program, which is funded by the Episcopal Church and private donations. 
Southeast Asians have been drawn recently by Stockton's farming and fishing. Sixty 
percent of the school's students are from Cambodia, Laos or Thailand. The five children 
killed were all Asian.</SUM>

Yesterday in Stockton, California, Patrick Edward Purdy turned an assault rifle on a 
crowded playground at Cleveland Elementary where he had been a student, killing five 
children and wounding 29 before killing himself. Most of the student body are children of 
Southeast Asian refugees. The quarter who came to school today were escorted past 
reporters. Flowers and an anti-racism banner adorned the entrance. Counselors assisted 
children in each classroom. Each child was given a stuffed animal at the principal's 
office. Purdy, a troubled loner with a history of alcoholism and brushes with the law, had 
wandered America looking for welding work. Toy soldiers were found in his Lodi motel

Midday on Tuesday, 26-year old drifter Patrick Edward Purdy set his car on fire then 
entered the grounds of Cleveland Elementary School, where he fired 60 rounds before 
killing himself.  He was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle and two handguns, one with 
the word "victory" on its handle. Students inside got under their desks and sixth-graders 
all cried. Neighbors were shocked by violence in their quiet town. The city has been 
changing with the arrival of Southeast Asian refugees. Buddhist priests in sandals and 
robes were among the clergy called to console families. 60% of the school's students are
