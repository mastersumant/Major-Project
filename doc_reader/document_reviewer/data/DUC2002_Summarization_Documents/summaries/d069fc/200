Through the first three months of 1989, 80,00 East Germans fled their country, and
massive demonstrations raised doubts that Erich Honeker the, hard-line Communist
leader could resist the democratic reforms sweeping his country. Street demonstrations
occurred throughout East Germany in November 1989, and the East German Communist
Party was forced to admit the its system had failed.

The West German constitution called for a united Germany, but it received little attention
until late 1989. The specter of a powerful undivided Germany troubled many, but
particularly the Soviets and Poles.

Matters moved quickly in early 1990. Soviet President Gorbachev gave West Germany
an unequivocal promise that German reunification would be honored. Two days later, on
the 12th of February, said that negotiations with East Germany should begin as soon as
possible after the 18 March East German elections. In time the World War II Allies
would endorse reunification.

With reunification imminent, world Jewish leaders asked for guarantees that the
Holocaust would not be repeated. Most prominent American historians agreed that a
stable Germany was a lesser threat to stability than the woeful conditions and near chaos
in East Germany.</SUM>
