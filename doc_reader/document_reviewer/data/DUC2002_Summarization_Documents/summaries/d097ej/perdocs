The leading edge of Hurricane Hugo, with winds up to 125 mph, will probably hit 
between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. after 8 p.m., local time. A hurricane 
warning was posted for Fernandina Beach, Fla., to Oregon Inlet, N.C. 

The Georgia Emergency Management Agency advised about 142,000 people to leave 
their homes. Gov. Harris declared a state of emergency in six counties.

South Carolina Gov. Campbell declared a state of emergency and dispatched 400 
National Guardsmen to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and 
shorefront. About one-fifth of the state's 3.1 million residents live in eight coastal 
counties.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday 
night. Dubbed a "killer hurricane" by Mayor Joseph Riley Jr., it is the first major 
hurricane to hit the 300-year-old city since 1959. 

The worst disaster to strike the city in recent decades was a tornado in 1938 that 
killed 32 people and injured hundreds. The worst natural disaster to beset the city 
ever occurred on Aug. 32, 1886, when an earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter 
scale struck, claiming 110 lives and destroying 102 buildings. 

Millions of tourists annually visit the historic city and its nearby beaches.</SUM>

National Hurricane Center forecasters used computer models to track Hugo's path 
into Charleston, giving people time to evacuate the South Carolina coast. A greater 
problem was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a 
Category 4 hurricane just hours before it hit Charleston. The increase in wind 
speed, which was detected by Air Force reconnaissance, surprised hurricane 
specialists.

Satellite information is fed to supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center 
in Suitland, Md. which send data to the hurricane center's tracking model. MIT 
meteorology professor Kerry Emmanuel criticizes the system because satellites 
don't provide sufficient wind and temperature data.</SUM>

Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday after thousands of 
coastal residents in southeastern states fled inland. A Red Cross spokesman said 
that it was sheltering thousands of evacuees and resources were very strained.

A National Hurricane Center official said hurricane-force winds first hit the coast 
by 9:15 p.m. EDT. About three hours later the eye of the storm, 10 miles across and 
with top winds at 135 mph, passed over the Isle of Palms east of Charleston. By 
midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston. The roof of City Hall, a 188-
year-old brick building, cracked.</SUM>

Late Thursday there was hope that Hugo might miss Charleston, but the storm 
gathered strength as it slammed into the city packing 135 mph winds. Mayor Joseph 
Riley Jr., other city officials and several reporters stayed in Charleston's historic 
City Hall Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades roared 
through. Before the night ended, a portion of the 188-year-old building's roof was 
ripped off and phone and power were knocked out. As the storm faded before dawn, 
Riley was out on the streets assessing the damage. "Serious, but fixable," the mayor 
concluded.</SUM>

Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley attributed the low number of fatalities from 
Hurricane Hugo to residents who monitored the strength of the hurricane and 
heeded evacuation warnings. The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 
17 lives in South Carolina, only two of which were in the Charleston area where 
Hugo's 135 mph winds were most prevalent. 

In the last decade several big storms have veered away from South Carolina, and 
officials feared that the latest warnings wouldn't be heeded. Instead, tens of 
thousands in Charleston and the three surrounding counties went to shelters or 
evacuated inland.</SUM>

According to an official of the American Insurance Service Group, "Hugo will be 
the biggest hurricane loss on record." State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance 
Co., for example, estimates it will pay clams totaling more than $400 million.  
Nationwide Insurance Co. said claims could total $100 million. Analysts, however, 
say most companies have sufficient funds to cover the losses and premium rate 
increases could be minimal.

Insurers also buy protection for themselves by paying another company a portion of 
the premium to bear some of the losses--called reinsurance. An investment analyst 
said losses from Hugo could temporarily increase reinsurance rates.</SUM>

State Farm Insurance Co., spokesman Jerry Parson, said the company expects 
Hurricane Hugo claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures 
20% of the homes. It is also projecting $100 million in claims from storm damage in 
North Carolina and Virginia.

Nationwide Insurance Co., the biggest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and 
the third largest insurer in South Carolina, expects storm claims near $100 million.

Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial 
health of any individual company. Short-term earnings of some publicly traded 
companies, however, might be affected.</SUM>

In March 1778, after the British torched Kingston, then the New York capital, 
South Carolina Gov. Livingston sent New York Gov. George Clinton 1,000 New 
York pounds with a letter saying, "This money has been received for the charitable 
purpose of alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the town of 
Kingston."  Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when 
Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolinas last week, and on Wednesday a local Red 
Cross chapter began collecting donations.

New York State is also airlifting relief supplies to the Caribbean and Puerto Rico 
which were also hard hit by Hugo.</SUM>

Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which struck the Carolinas and the Caribbean last 
week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.

American International Group Inc., which insured property in Puerto Rico, the 
Caribbean and the Carolinas, expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax 
earnings between $35 and 45 million.

St. Paul Cos., said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.

State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates claim payments from Hugo 
will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone.

An insurance industry analyst said 35% to 45% of Cigna's $1.40-a-share third
