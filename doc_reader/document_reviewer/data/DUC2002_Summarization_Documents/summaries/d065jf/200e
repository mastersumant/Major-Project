<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="13" wdcount="27"> The Quayle family and friends were
celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the
41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice
president.</s>

<s docid="AP880818-0023" num="9" wdcount="23"> Dan Quayle has not yet been
nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to
Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.</s>

<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="28" wdcount="27"> Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who
placed Quayle's name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought
to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="10" wdcount="33"> Encumbered by his image as a
political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early
campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has
few intimates or allies.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="31" wdcount="28"> Democrats portrayed Quayle during
the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative
accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="33" wdcount="34"> Quayle didn't help his case by
making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst
being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I
didn't live in this century''.</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="11" wdcount="48"> Relegated in the campaign to small
towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a
traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state
funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush
had, some scholars feel.</s>
