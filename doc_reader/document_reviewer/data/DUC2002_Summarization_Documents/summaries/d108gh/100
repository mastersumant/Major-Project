On August 2nd, 1990, Iraq occupied Kuwait with 100,000 troops, destroying government 
buildings and installations, killing 200, and replacing fleeing Kuwaitis with Iraqis. 
Saddam Hussain accused Kuwait of overproducing to drive down oil prices and stealing 
oil from Iraqi border wells. Iraq claimed it invaded at revolutionaries' request. Kuwait 
said Iraq invaded because Kuwait pressed for war loan repayment. Kuwait appealed for 
US and UN help. Bush pledged to defend its Persian Gulf interests and sent a naval 
group. The US, UN, and EEC imposed widely-supported trade and military sanctions 
against Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq threatened to hold citizens of sanction-imposing countries 
hostage. Oil prices soared.</SUM>
