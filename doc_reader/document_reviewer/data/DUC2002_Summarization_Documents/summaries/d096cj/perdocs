New, tougher tax laws on what can be claimed as business entertainment expense haven't 
slowed demand for tickets to Sunday's Super Bowl XXI. Now, only 80% of the face 
value to tickets to sporting events can be deducted, and then only if a substantial business 
discussion occurs. The face value of a 50-yard-line seat at the Super Bowl is $75, not 
$1500, the going rate. Meals are 80% deductible if business is discussed. Still, hundreds 
of companies will send their officials and customers to Pasadena for a weekend of 
partying. The IRS will have difficulty disputing claims that business was discussed.</SUM>

Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left in the game 
gave the San Francisco 49ers a 20-16 Super Bowl victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on 
Sunday. The touchdown gave Montana a Super Bowl record with 357 yards passing. 
Wide receiver Jerry Rice caught 12 passes for 222 yards, both Super Bowl records, and 
was named the game's most valuable player. It was the third Super Bowl win for 49ers 
Coach Bill Walsh.

It was the fifth straight win for the NFC team and the most dramatic. The previous four 
had an average score of 41-14.</SUM>

In a White House reception on Friday, President Bush congratulated the San Francisco 
49ers on their third Super Bowl title in eight years, saying they "rewrote the record 
books." Bush, in turn, was presented with autographed balls by quarterback Joe Montana 
and wide receiver Jerry Rice, the game's Most Valuable Player. Outgoing coach Bill 
Walsh gave Bush a 49ers jogging outfit. 

The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, two weeks ago in Miami. The winning 
touchdown late in the fourth quarter was the culmination of a 92-yard drive by Montana.

Super Bowl winners are traditionally invited to the White House.</SUM>

Anheuser Busch Cos.Inc, and Miller Brewing Co. will attempt to take advantage of the 
hype preceding Super Bowl XXIV by running television commercials featuring mock 
football games. Anheuser Bush's campaign features a "Bud Bowl II" that culminates 
during the Jan.28 game in New Orleans. The ad revolves around animated teams of 
Budwieser and Bud Light beer bottles playing on a pint-sized football field.

Miller has already launched its 12-week campaign centered on a football game between 
"Tastes Great" and "Less Filling" squads, both of which are composed of former NFL 
players. Miller admits its promotion costs over $7 million.</SUM>

The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided 
Super Bowl victory ever. The 24th Super Bowl also generated other statistics. The 49ers, 
having also won in 1989, 1985 and 1982, tied the Pittsburgh Steelers as a pinnacle of 
Super Bowl perfection with four wins in four tries. San Francisco quarterback Joe 
Montana, broke the record for touchdown passes, 5. He also set a record for straight pass 
completions, 13. Montana set five Super Bowl career records, including his third Super 
Bowl MVP award, and San Francisco's point total was the most ever.</SUM>

The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the Denver Broncos was the lowest rated Super 
Bowl since 1969 and the third-lowest ever. The CBS game averaged a 39.0 rating and a 
63 share. Each point in the rating represents 921,000 homes. The share is the percentage 
of the televisions on at the time. Despite the low rating, about 108.5 million people saw 
Sunday's game, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in the U.S. behind eight 
Super Bowls and the final episode of "Mash." The annual increase in the number of 
homes with television accounted for the higher viewership.</SUM>

Though 63% of TV viewers or approximately 109 million people watched Super Bowl 
XXIV on CBS, the network finished the week in the cellar in the ratings race. The 
lopsided game was the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969. Each rating point in 1990, 
however, represents many more households than it did two decades ago. 

This marks only the third time that the Super Bowl network did not win the week and 
only the second time that it was third for the week. On the upside, the game was a good 
lead-in to the new CBS series, "Grand Slam."</SUM>

The Los Angeles Sports Council will offer the NFL incentives to hold Super Bowl 
XXVII in the Rose Bowl in 1993, including rent-free use of the stadium and all income 
from concession sales. The Rose Bowl has also proposed an $8.3-million press box 
renovation. 

The city would receive approximately $210,000 in taxes and parking fees.

The Council represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to attract major 
sports events here.

In a report to the city Board of Directors, Pasadena's deputy city manager Ed Aghjayan 
said the stadium is commonly offered rent-free in exchange for the benefits to local 
economies.</SUM>

About 100,000 people will visit Tampa this week for the festivities leading up to Super 
Bowl XXV, and this year, unlike in 1984, the black community is sharing in the profits 
generated by the game. The economic impact of the Super Bowl on a city can be $200 
million. Several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the NFL 
for the game. 

It also can highlight a community's problems. This year the Gasparilla Parade, sponsored 
by an all-white, all-male private club that refused to integrate, was cancelled. Henry 
Carly, president of the local NAACP chapter, is co-chairman of the replacement 
extravaganza.</SUM>
