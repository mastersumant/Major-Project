Lucille Ball, who died in April 1989 at the age of 77, will long be
remembered.  She made her craft look easy, spontaneous and
unrehearsed.  The result was the durable and probably the finest
series in television history, "I Love Lucy".  She starred with her
husband, Desi Arnaz, in the '50s show and together they founded Desilu
Productions, which eventually took over RKO Studios.  She was an
astute businesswoman as well as a talented entertainer and Desilu
produced some of the most popular programs of the '50s and '60s. Ball
and Arnaz divorced in 1960.  They had two children.  At her death
there was an outpouring of sympathy from the very famous to thousands
of her ordinary fans.  She was particularly remembered in her hometown
of Jamestown New York where she had contributed to local charities,
civic events and Jamestown Community College.  Following the breakup
of her first marriage, she married Gary Morton, her husband at her
death.  Miss Ball had a successful career before television, starring
in 75 films.  She died in Los Angeles, following emergency heart
surgery.  William Paley, Chairman of CBS said that she helped to
establish television as the nation's leading entertainment industry
and that her legacy would last forever.</SUM>
