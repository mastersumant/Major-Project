India and Pakistan have feuded over Jammu-Kashmir since the subcontinent
was divided in 1947.  It is India's only predominately Moslem state with 64%
of its five million people Moslem.  Moslem separatists began a campaign of
violence in Jammu-Kashmir hoping initially to lead to union with Pakistan
but later for independence.  Indian authorities began a crackdown in January
1990, and by summer, over a thousand people died.  India accused Pakistan of
arming and training the insurgents, a charge Pakistan denied.  Despite
incidences of soldiers firing across cease-fire lines, the two countries
said the situation was local and not serious.</SUM>
