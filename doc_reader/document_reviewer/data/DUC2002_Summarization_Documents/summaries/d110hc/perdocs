Iraqi and Kuwaiti negotiators met privately in Jiddah on Tuesday to defuse their border 
and oil dispute as 100,000 Iraqi troops massed on the border. Another meeting is 
scheduled for Wednesday.

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein touched off the crisis on 17 July when he accused 
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of exceeding the quotas of oil production set by 
OPEC, and said Kuwait was illegally pumping oil from a field that straddles an unmarked 
border. Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait, and has coveted two Kuwaiti 
islands that command Iraq's only access to the Persian Gulf.</SUM>

Iraq's powerful army, led by the Republican Guard, invaded Kuwait today and quickly 
overran the small oil-rich country. Kuwait's armed forces number only 20,300. Iraq 
claimed the invasion was launched at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries. Kuwait 
immediately appealed for United States help.

There were wide-ranging ramifications. Oil prices shot up three dollars per barrel. The 
United States froze Iraqi assets, and blocked oil imports. The Soviet Union, Iraq's main 
arms supplier, halted weapons sales. The United Nations Security Council voted 14-0 to 
denounce the invasion and demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces.</SUM>

Iraq says it invaded Kuwait in response to a request from a Kuwaiti revolutionary 
organization. The diplomatic community is not convinced by the statements issued in the 
name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government. The United States and the Soviet

Iraq has been feuding with Kuwait over a border dispute, and over Kuwait's alleged 
violation of its OPEC-ordained oil production quota. Iraq also alleges that Kuwait was 
working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers in plotting against Iraq. That charge 
was made when tensions began to rise in mid-July.</SUM>

An emergency session of the foreign ministers of the Arab League was convened in Cairo 
at Kuwait's request soon after Iraq's military forces overran the small Persian Gulf 
nation. Kuwait asked the League to condemn the attack. Only Lebanon joined Kuwait in 
publicly condemning the action, the first time in modern history one Arab nation has 
taken over the government of another. Kuwait invoked the 1950 Joint Defense Pact that 
calls on League members to come to the aid of any member that is a victim of military 
action. The first session adjourned without taking any action.</SUM>

Iraqi troops, led by 350 tanks, crossed the border early Thursday and quickly seized 
government buildings in Kuwait City. They were also sweeping through southern 
Kuwaiti oilfields. Iraq has a population of 17 million, and boasts the Arab world's most 
battled-trained army. Sixty percent of Kuwait's inhabitants are foreigners. Iraq had 
accused Kuwait of stealing oil from a disputed border area, and forcing down oil prices 
through overproduction.

President Bush denounced the invasion as "naked aggression". United States naval

Kuwait. Iraqi troops quickly occupied government all government buildings in the

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein saw the invasion of Kuwait as an opportunity to solve his 
financial problems and fulfill his territorial ambitions. Iraq's eight-year war with Iran left 
Iraq with a 70 billion dollar debt that was a drag on the economy. Saddam was incensed 
that Kuwait demanded repayment of wartime loans. Hussein also accused Kuwait of 
stealing 2.4 billion dollars worth of oil from a disputed border area, and costing Iraq oil 
revenue by ignoring production quotas established by OPEC. By controlling Kuwait, Iraq 
could also fulfill its longstanding wish to for more gulf coastline.</SUM>

Saudi Arabia offered shelter to the Kuwaiti ruling family after they fled their homeland 
Thursday. For a brief period the Kuwaitis in Saudi Arabia were allowed to air radio

Oil executives said that Saudi Arabia has not and will not close the pipeline that carries 
Iraqi oil across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea because they do not want to provoke an Iraqi

Saudi Arabia's reaction to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has been subdued. The presence 
of Iraqi forces near the border concerns the Saudis who do not want to provoke Iraq into

reason for believing Saudi Arabia will not close the pipeline that carries exported Iraqi oil

Saudi Arabia did join the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in low-key

In Sunday meetings United States urged the United Nations to impose broad economic

comprehensive sanctions, with only Cuba abstaining. Only the five permanent members

The Iraqi News Service said other countries should not take "punishing action" against 
Iraq, and in what sounded like a warning, said that countries should remember their

Japan and the European Community joined in the embargo of Iraqi oil. The reduced

consequences. World oil prices soared to their highest prices in four years. Thursday the 
United Nations Security Council condemned the invasion, and on Monday approved
