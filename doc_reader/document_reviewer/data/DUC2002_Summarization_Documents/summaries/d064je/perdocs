Communism's first taste of a Big Mac occurred with the opening of a McDonald's in 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The opening of the first of six McDonald's in Yugoslavia in the 
next five years drew large crowds. Many stood in line for up to three hours to get their 
first taste of an American hamburger. The opening may be the beginning of a competition 
between the Big Mac and Yugoslavia's traditional hamburger-like fast food, the 
Pljeskavica. Priced about the same as the Pljeskavica, the Big Mac will be offered in a 
setting that discourages lounging, bans smoking and is alcohol free; a sharp contrast to 
traditional Balkan dining custom.</SUM>

With 27 cash registers and seating for 900, the world's largest McDonald's opened in 
Moscow on Wednesday to mixed reviews for the Big Mac and high praise for its 
strawberry milkshakes, called cocktails by the Russians. Choosing from 25,000 
applicants, McDonald's trained 630 workers in Western marketing techniques. Clerks are 
trained to say "please" and "thank-you" as well  as observing new standards of 
cleanliness. The ingredients used at the restaurant are provided by Soviet farms, but 
McDonald's provided farmers with special training and disease-resistant seeds for the 
process. At 3.75 rubles (around five U.S. dollars) for a Big Mac, feeding a family at 
McDonald's could cost the average Soviet worker two-day's wages.</SUM>

McDonald's opened their first restaurant in China on Monday the in city of Shenzhen. 
China has long been known for its cuisine but most Chinese workers, who average 
$32.00 a month, are unable to afford fancy restaurants. Even the higher wages of 
Shenzhen, where workers average $53.00 a month, the $1.14 cost of the Big Mac along 
with 48 cents for fries and 74 cents for a shake may cause the Chinese to view eating at 
McDonald's as a treat rather than a convenience.  Such is the case with Kentucky Fried 
Chicken, which opened its first restaurant in Peking three years ago.  While popular, the 
Chinese still consider eating there a treat.</SUM>

The world's largest McDonald's served 30,00 customers on its opening day in Moscow, 
breaking the opening day record for McDonald's worldwide. A crush of people lined up 
before dawn outside the 700 seat restaurant. To accommodate the crowds, McDonald's 
stayed open two hours past its closing time. The Big Mac, priced at 3.75 rubles, costs 
about two hours pay for the average Russian worker. Even so, McDonald's is still much 
cheaper that other private restaurants in Moscow. The Soviets got their first look at 
friendly and efficient service and, for most Russians, their first experience with a 
hamburger. To guarantee its supplies, McDonald's built its own factory, including a 
bakery, dairy, and meat processing plant; important in a country where up to 25 percent 
of the harvest rots en route to the customer.</SUM>

In the midst of tough economic times, McDonald's opened its second restaurant in 
Moscow as part of a 12 story office block. As the value of the ruble plunges, Russian 
officials had reason to celebrate McDonald's hamburgers. Although Russian authorities 
have been pleased with McDonald's, citing the fact that most of their supplies come from 
Russia, the plunging ruble as well as high inflation and changing tax laws have proven 
difficult for McDonald's. McDonald's officials admitted that they do not know when 
they will recoup their original 50M investment. McDonald's hopes to generate hard 
currency by renting out offices to western companies to augment the rubles made from 
selling hamburgers.</SUM>

After 7 years of negotiation with the South Korean government, McDonald's opened the 
first of what it hopes to be a string of restaurants in Seoul. Opened by McAhn Industries, 
a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's and accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo 
Young, McDonald's struggled with the government over tight import restrictions and 
McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. The import question was settled by finding a local 
supplier of high quality beef and potatoes at a value. With a growing middle class, Korea 
may be McDonald's most promising foreign market. Expected to benefit from the 1988 
Olympic Games, McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly and avoid extravagance.</SUM>

The communist world will get its first taste of an American hamburger next week when 
McDonald's opens its doors in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Offering Big Macs, fries and other 
McDonald's specialties, some wonder if McDonald's will be as popular as the local fast-
food treat, Pljeskavica. Described as a clash between the Big Mac and the Pljeskavica, 
the success of McDonald's depends on the acceptance by the Yugoslavs of the Big Mac 
over the Pljeskavica. The Pljeskavica, made of ground pork and onions, is served on 
bread and sells for about a dollar. McDonald's is scheduled to open a restaurant in 
Budapest, Hungary, next year but an agreement to expand into the Soviet Union has yet 
to be reached.</SUM>
