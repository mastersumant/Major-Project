On April 24, 1990, shuttle Discovery carried the 12.5-ton Hubble Space
Telescope 380 miles into space. Orbiting above Earth's distorting
atmosphere, Hubble would see 10 times better than the largest Earth
telescopes. Technical problems exacerbated by conservative system
settings put Hubble several days behind schedule. Discovery's five
astronauts were all veterans of previous flights. Discovery followed
Hubble for two days to assist if necessary. Spacelab Astro was to be
put up two weeks later to give additional target information. Hubble
cost $1.5 billion, with millions more projected for support over its
15-year lifetime. Discovery carried a telescope eyepiece used by Edwin
Hubble, for whom the Hubble is named.</SUM>
