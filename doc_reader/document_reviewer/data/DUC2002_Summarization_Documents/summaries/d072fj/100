Leonard Bernstein, the beloved internationally acclaimed maestro died on October 14th at 
72 of lung failure. Within days, the New York Philharmonic, in tribute to its 47-year 
association with the brilliant conductor played a special program, as did several other 
orchestras. Recently, Broadway also honored Bernstein, composer of "West Side Story," 
with a special show at the Majestic Theater. Several record companies will accelerate re-
releases of Bernstein recordings.

Bernstein though ill for some time, did participate in his 70th birthday celebrations at 
Tanglewood and Carnegie Hall. The latter occurred on the 45th anniversary of his 
directorial debut with the Philharmonic.</SUM>
