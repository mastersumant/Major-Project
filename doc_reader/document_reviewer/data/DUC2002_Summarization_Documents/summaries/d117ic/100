The Booker Prize was established in 1969 to honor the best work of fiction by a British 
or Commonwealth author. It is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming 
business. The Booker carries a substantial monetary award, and is now Britain's most 
prestigious fiction prize. Judges name six finalists, and later select the winner from those 
six. The competition creates great interest and motivates bettors. It also boosts book sales.

Three of the recent winners now live in Britain or a Commonwealth country, but were 
born elsewhere. Only books written in English can be entered into Booker competition.</SUM>
