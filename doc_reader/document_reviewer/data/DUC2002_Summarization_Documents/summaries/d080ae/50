The McMartin Pre-School child molestation trial ended in acquittal for Raymond Buckey 
and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey. The jury found the McMartins innocent of 52 
counts, but deadlocked on another 13, causing a mistrial on those counts. Parents of the 
children involved in the trial were angry and expressed disappointment with the acquittal.</SUM>
