<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="6" wdcount="37"> With the old order of Bolshevik power and ideology in ruins, 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev demanded the resignation Friday of his entire 
government and Russian President Boris Yeltsin shut down Communist Party

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="13" wdcount="49"> In a joint appearance with Gorbachev in 
the Russian parliament, broadcast live on Soviet television, Yeltsin made it

agrees to share power and intensify the march toward a democratic political 
system and a market economy.</s>
