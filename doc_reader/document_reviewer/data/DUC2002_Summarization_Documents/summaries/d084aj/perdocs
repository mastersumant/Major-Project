At least 47 crewmen died today in an explosion in one of three giant WWII-era gun 
turrets on the battleship Iowa. The Defense Department said the explosion possibly 
resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fires shells weighing over 
a ton a distance of up to 23 miles. 

The Iowa was commissioned in 1943 and most recently returned to service in December 
1982. It was on a training exercise about 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico. 

The Iowa was headed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico and was in no 
danger of sinking.</SUM>

The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the Iowa gun explosion arrived at Dover AFB, 
Delaware on Thursday. Notifications of next of kin began late Wednesday.
 
The blast occurred Wednesday as the Iowa was engaging in firing exercises northeast of 
Puerto Rico. Navy officials said none of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before 
the explosion, but officials would not publicly speculate on the cause of the disaster. 
Defense Secretary Cheney said there are no eyewitness survivors. 

The Iowa, a WWII leviathan reactivated by Reagan, was returning to its home port, 
Norfolk, Va., with naval investigators aboard.</SUM>

The Navy has imposed a moratorium on firing the 16-inch guns on the Iowa and its three 
sister battleships, as investigators begin searching for the cause of the explosion on the 
Iowa that claimed 47. Officials won't speculate on what caused the blast in the Iowa's 
No. 2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico. 
Eleven men escaped from powder magazines at the base of the turret. 

Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the battleship New Jersey, began a 
board of inquiry's investigation. Most victims were between 18 and 22 years old.</SUM>

Retired Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday 
that the 16-inch guns on the Iowa, which can fire a 2,700 pound shell a distance of 20 
miles are "old-fashioned and inherently dangerous."  The main criticism is that six 110-
pound silk bags of gunpowder are required to fire the projectile. Hot debris may remain 
or explosive gases can build up in the barrel, igniting powder before the breech is closed. 

Capt. Larry Seaquist, former commander of the Iowa, defended the gun, saying it is 
"[the] finest naval gun in the world and it is still a front-line system."</SUM>

Sailors wearing black arm bands lined the rails of the ship which had an explosion in its 
No. 2 gun turret Wednesday during exercises near Puerto Rico. Forty-seven crewmen 
died. Eleven people inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the 
ship's magazines, survived, the Navy said. Two of the 11 survivors stood atop the fire-
blackened turret at the docking.

complete the exams of the remaining 35 sailors. No cause of death was announced for 
any sailors.

Meanwhile, the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, was opened in Norfolk and sailors 
talked about their pride in battleships and sense of loss.

are aboard searching for clues to the blast.</SUM>

Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooley said Sunday that it could take months before the 
investigation into the cause of the explosion that killed 47 aboard the battleship USS 
Iowa is completed and the results made public. A seven-member team of investigators 
boarded the battleship a day after the Wednesday explosion in the battleship's No. 2 gun 
turret. 

The Navy won't speculate on the cause of the explosion, but Sunday's New York Times 
cited unidentified sources saying that it occurred while the 550-pound propellant bags 
were being loaded into the gun. Eleven survivors inside the turret were all loading 
powder.</SUM>

Relatives of the 47 victims killed in the No.2 gun explosion aboard the Iowa last 
Wednesday were among the 6000 people who attended a memorial at Norfolk Naval Air 
Station on Monday. President Bush, a WWII Navy pilot, and the ship's commander, 
Capt. Fred P. Moosally, led the service.

Moosally praised the No. 2 gun turret crew as the best on the ship. At the end of the 
service, President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men.

As many as 500 Iowa crewmen, delayed by traffic, were unable to attend because of 
presidential security measures.</SUM>
