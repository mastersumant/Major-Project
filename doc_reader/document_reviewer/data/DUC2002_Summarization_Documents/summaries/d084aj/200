Relatives of the 47 victims killed in the explosion aboard the Iowa
last Wednesday were among the 6000 people who attended a memorial at
Norfolk Naval Air Station on Monday. President Bush and Iowa commander
Capt. Moosally attended the service.

The USS Iowa, a WW II battleship returned to duty in 1982, was
conducting firing exercises northeast of Puerto Rico when the blast
occurred in the No. 2 gun turret. The Defense Department said it
possibly originated from a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells
weighing over a ton a distance of 23 miles. Eleven people inside the
turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder, survived the Navy
said. The gun had not been fired.  Two of the 11 survivors stood atop
the fire-blackened turret when the Iowa docked at Norfolk Naval Base
Sunday.

The Navy released a videotape of the explosion made by an officer of
the Iowa who was recording the firing of the big guns, but it won't
speculate on the cause of the tragedy.

The Navy is investigating the causes of the accident and the Senate
Armed Services Committee will hold hearings.

The Pentagon ordered a moratorium on firings of the 16-inch
guns.</SUM>
