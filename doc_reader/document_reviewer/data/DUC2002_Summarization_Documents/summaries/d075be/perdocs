According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a 
heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.  
In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF 
beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections. TGF beta is 
normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the 
simulated heart attack. The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the 
amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue. Hearts damaged by a heart attack tended to 
lose creatine kinase.</SUM>

Tests of Diltiazem, a calcium entry blocker, indicate that its use could prevent recurring 
heart attacks in a majority of patients. The chance of another attack decreased 80 percent 
in the patients. Significantly, however, the chance for a heart attack in patients with heart 
pumping problems increased by 25 percent. This suggests that more patients will be put 
on the drug on a long-term basis.  Diltiazem is the newest in a class of drugs introduced 
to fight heart disease. Nitrates, in use for over 50 years, and beta blockers, which were 
developed in the 1960s, are other treatments commonly prescribed by doctors.</SUM>

A study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that an 
intestinal operation to lower cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced the risk of a 
second heart attack. Called a partial ileal bypass, changes the route of the small intestine 
so that one-third of it is bypassed. Although lowering the risk of a second heart attack, a 
major drawback of the procedure is chronic diarrhea, which can last for years. Patients 
also are more prone to kidney stones, gallstones, and intestinal obstructions. Patients with 
severe heart damage were not helped by the procedure.</SUM>

Aspirin can be a significant factor in reducing the number of heart attacks. Taking a 
single aspirin every other day could cut the risk of a heart attack in half. When used with 
a clot-dissolving drug, given within 24 hours of a heart attack, the chance of a second 
heart attack is reduced from 13 percent to 8 percent.  Many doctors still are not using 
clot-dissolving drugs but it is felt that, in the future, their use will be considered safe 
enough to allow paramedics to administer them to patients on the way to the hospital. 
Using a clot dissolver and aspirin could save 25,000 lives a year.</SUM>

Danish studies of the drug Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, show that the drug 
reduces the chance of a new heart attack in patients recovering from a heart attack. This 
is the first trial to indicate that calcium blockers may be helpful after a heart attack. 
Verapamil is about  as effective as beta blockers in protecting people after heart attacks 
and may be useful in instances where beta blockers cannot be used. Many people do not 
tolerate beate blockers, especially those suffering from asthma and emphysema. 
Verapamil was effective in decreasing mortality in the first 12 to 18 months following a 
heart attack.</SUM>

An experiment indicates that a blood and urine test of individuals with high blood 
pressure can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack. The test also can 
determine those patients whose risk of heart attack is extremely low. The test determines 
whether the kidneys are releasing too much renin into the blood. People with high levels 
of rennin are at a high risk of heart attack. The test can be especially useful for 
determining heart attack risks in patients without any of the usual risk factors. Those in 
this group with high rennin levels were seven times more likely to suffer a heart attack.</SUM>

Although the death rate from heart attacks and blood vessels diseases has dropped 24 
percent in the last decade, they remain the number one cause of death in the United 
States. This decline can be attributed to changing life styles, which includes fewer 
cigarettes, better food and better medical treatment.  Despite this decrease, it is believed 
that up to 50 percent of the heart disease cased by the clogging of blood vessels feeding 
the heart; the most lethal heart ailment. Lowering cholesterol levels and educating people 
to get to the hospital  within three to four hours of the first sign of a heart attack would 
significantly increase survival rates.</SUM>

Releasing a heart attack victim from the hospital as soon as three days after their attack 
are becoming more common with new medical treatments. The early discharges are made 
possible with the introduction of tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and balloon 
angioplasty. TPA, given right after a heart attack, can dissolve clots while angioplasty 
can open up clogged arteries. Patients sent home early can return to work earlier that 
those kept longer, while the number of medical problems suffered by both groups after 
six months were similar. The earlier release also has the benefit of significantly reducing 
medical costs.</SUM>

Phase  2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial, or TIMI-II, has shown that 
the routine practice of using balloon angioplasty is unnecessary and should be 
abandoned. The first phase of the study showed that giving tissue plasminogen activator, 
or TPA,  a clot-dissolving drug, right after a heart attack dramatically improved chances 
of survival. A trial involving a group given angiolplasty and a group given TPA did not 
show any difference in survival rates after a year. This finding indicates that smaller 
community hospitals can treat most heart attack patients. Patients needing angioplasty 
could be transferred to larger hospitals for treatment.</SUM>

Doctors are being cautioned not to routinely prescribe aspirin in the prevention of heart 
attacks. This word from the Food and Drug Administration comes after findings which 
suggest that aspirin therapy may increase the possibility of stroke in some patients. 
Individuals most at risk are those with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure. 
This warning comes after a study, published in January, which indicated that an aspirin 
taken every other day reduced the risk of a non-fatal first heart attack by 47 percent as 
compared to a group taking a non-aspirin substitute.</SUM>
