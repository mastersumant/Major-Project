New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have 
significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States. The introduction of 
calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage 
caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin, taken every other day, also 
reduces heart attack risk.  Aspiring, when taken with clot-busting drugs, has been shown 
to be especially helpful. Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass 
also show promise in the treatment of heart disease. Even life style changes like smoking 
less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack.</SUM>
