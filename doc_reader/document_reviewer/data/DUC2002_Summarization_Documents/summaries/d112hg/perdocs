British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, said Monday 
he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper worth "hundreds of millions of dollars." 
The newspaper was not identified but there is speculation that it might be The New York Daily 
News, which is struggling to restore profitability; USA Today, which would mesh with 
Maxwell's efforts for the new paper The European; or the Chicago Sun-Times that has been 
sliding in circulation since 1985.

Officials of each of these newspapers denied they were negotiating with Maxwell, who recently 
bought three US tabloids: the Globe, National Examiner, and the Sun.</SUM>

Following his takeover of the unprofitable New York Daily News, British publisher Robert 
Maxwell plans to raise about #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of shares in his Mirror 
Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain.  Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror.

In other changes, his son Ian, appointed Deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign his post 
as Joint Deputy Managing Director at Maxwell Communications whose management will be 
taken over by his brother Kevin.

Robert Maxwell bought Mirror Group in 1984 for #113 million and built it into one of Britain's
most profitable newspaper groups.</SUM>

Robert Maxwell, the flamboyant millionaire who built a global publishing empire, was found 
dead yesterday in waters off the Canary Islands where he had been vacationing on his yacht. 
Maxwell, 68, who earlier this year had bought the New York Daily News, vanished overnight 
from his yacht.

The Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who escaped the Holocaust and immigrated to Britain in 1940, 
personally ran his own publishing empire. His sons Kevin and Ian took over the business 
Tuesday. His death prompted immediate concern in British financial circles about the future of 
his debt-laden empire and the future of the New York Daily News.</SUM>

Investigators say the late publishing magnate Robert Maxwell siphoned money from his 
companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts. A government prosecution agency 
investigating his Mirror Group pension fund assets says that $630 million was taken from the 
fund without authority. His son Kevin says the debts are so enormous nothing is left for the 
pensioners. Reportedly, Maxwell never created the pension fund promised to New York Daily 
News managers. Creditors face losses of $905 million. Kevin admitted his father was a crook, 
and he and his brother Ian are under investigation for their knowledge of Robert Maxwell's 
companies.</SUM>

Two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank are under investigation 
by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for involvement in an illegal scheme to support the Maxwell 
Communication Corporation (MCC) share price. Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin, the owners 
of MCC, are being investigated by SFO for failure to disclose purchases of shares by Swiss 
Trusts as required by company law.

A directive of a secretive Swiss trust said the purchases, using brokers, had been "going on for 
some time" and were bought for other "foundations" and then held for a certain time.</SUM>

About 20 banks were concerned last summer at the behavior of businesses run by Robert 
Maxwell before his empire collapsed. Although concerned about the impact of late payments, the 
banks did not discuss those concerns with each other.  The banks were involved in a flurry of 
foreign exchange deals in which the Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) would buy 
currency in one financial center while promising to make payment in another center. Several 
times, MCC received the currency but didn't make the payment, thereby giving themselves an 
unauthorized loan. Last year, MCC made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund 
assets.</SUM>

Michael Stoney, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, and Kevin and Ian 
Maxwell, the sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the three top persons involved in at 
least 28 "unusual" payments from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) bank accounts. Accounts 
notes show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of #421.5 million, including millions in 
pension deficiencies and in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies.

It is believed some MGN directors did not know there was anything improper about the 
transactions. They accepted assurances from the treasury department headed by Mr. Stoney. 
Reportedly, the system had many weaknesses.</SUM>

Chess and Bridge yesterday took over the business assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and 
Bridge. The late Robert Maxwell thought of himself as a "strong" chess player. There may be 
doubts about his strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game. In 1990, he 
sponsored a section of the World Chess Championships in New York. When Pergamon was sold 
to Elsevier last year, Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses.

Despite of year of difficulties in buying the Maxwell businesses, which include Chess Monthly 
and Bridge Monthly, Chess and Bridge is now set up in London.</SUM>

In a move regarded as without precedent, the attorney general will apply for an injunction to stop 
the production of a West End show about the late Robert Maxwell. He was prompted by fears the 
musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian. Lawyers say it 
is no more unprecedented than the brothers having to commute to their trial past the theater 
advertising the story of their father.

Press coverage of the late publisher has already caused concern to the Maxwell brothers' 
lawyers. The show's producer said the show would go on while he contests the injunction.</SUM>

Trustees filed two writs last week in Manhattan for Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Scheme 
and Maxwell Communications Corporation Works Pension Scheme. The writs allege that 
Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting currency from the two 
Robert Maxwell-controlled pension schemes to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interest 
would be repaid.

The writs center on the purchase of #55 million of MCC shares from the pension schemes of the 
two Swiss trusts which were transacted through Goldman. Allegedly, Kevin Maxwell told 
Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale to a trust Goldman knew to be Maxwell owned.</SUM>
