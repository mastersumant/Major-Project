Category 4 Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage in the eastern Caribbean on Sep 17, 
1989, and on the 21st hit Charleston, South Carolina with 135mph winds. It killed 17 in 
the state. Coastal residents fled inland or crowded into shelters. Satellites, a computerized 
tracking model, and Air Force reconnaissance planes helped forecasters at the National 
Hurricane Center monitor Hugo's progress. Pinpointing landfall and intensity were 
difficult. Billions in insurance claims made Hugo the most expensive storm to date. 
Ocean warming caused by the greenhouse effect could increase future storms' destructive 
power, demonstrated by Hugo jumping from 105 to 135mph winds as it passed over the 
Gulf Stream.</SUM>
