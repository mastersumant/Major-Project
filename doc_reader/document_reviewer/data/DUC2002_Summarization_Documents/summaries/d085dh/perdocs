Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday and officials hoped 
precautions were sufficient. As Hugo approached, roads and resort towns from Hilton 
Head to Myrtle Beach were nearly empty as coastal residents fled inland and crowded 
into shelters. Hurricane-force winds first hit land at 9:15pm. Three hours later the 10-mile 
eye of the storm passed just east of Charleston, with top winds of 135 mph. 119-mph 
winds in Charleston brought down power lines, snapped trees, exploded utility 
transformers, and littered the street with tin roofs. Schools and businesses were closed. 
Hugo was expected to turn north, cause severe flooding, and bring tornadoes.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo raged into Charleston Thursday night packing 135-mph winds. Few 
residents had experienced such a dangerous, killer hurricane, the first major storm to 
strike the city since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles south in 1959.  In 1938, a 
tornado tore through the city killing 32, injuring hundreds, and causing $2 million in 
property damage. The worst natural disaster to hit Charleston occurred Aug 31, 1886, 
when an earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale claimed 110 lives, destroyed 102 
buildings, and tossed most of the city's chimneys into the streets. The city has survived 
two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes, which residents call "September gales."</SUM>

At the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida, forecasters working 12-hour 
days monitored Hurricane Hugo using computers and satellites. They calculated where it 
would strike and got emergency operations going in those areas. Director Bob Sheets  
appeared on TV all week and credited the ever-present but bothersome media with 
getting the word out. A hurricane warning, involving emergency preparations and 
evacuation plans, costs $50 million. Before the warning system was established, a Hugo-
sized storm would have killed thousands. So far there were no reports of coastal-area 
deaths. After Hugo's landfall, forecasters relaxed but still followed three other Atlantic 
weather systems and one in the Pacific.</SUM>

Hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science, but forecasters' predictions of Hugo's 
destructive path gave people time to flee South Carolina's coast. Their expertise was 
assisted by satellite information sent by supercomputers at the National Meteorological 
Center in Suitland, Maryland. At the National Hurricane Center, a tracking model 
embodying knowledge of meteorological conditions and indicators of change constantly 
reflected weather conditions and storm position. Pinpointing landfall was difficult. Also, 
computer models can't reliably predict a storm's intensity. Air Force reconnaissance 
planes flying into the storm still provide important data about wind speed and 
temperatures. Before the satellites of the late 1960s, reports from aircraft or ships were 
the only forecasting tools.</SUM>

Hurricane Hugo started as a tropical wave off Africa on Sept. 11th, was named tropical 
storm Hugo with 39mph winds on Sep 12th, and became a hurricane with 74mph winds 
on Sep 13th. On Sep 15th it was designated Category 4 with 150mph winds. On Sep 17th 
it damaged Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, St. Kitts, and the Virgin Islands, where St. 
Thomas and St. Croix were worst hit. On Sep 18th it damaged Puerto Rico. Winds 
slowed to 105 mph then returned to 135mph and Category 4 designation on the 21st, 
when it hit Charleston. It continued inland with diminishing winds on the 22nd and was 
downgraded to a tropical storm.</SUM>

With unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions, world temperatures could 
rise 10 degrees and the greenhouse effect could breed hurricanes 50% stronger than 
Hugo, which blasted the Caribbean and Carolinas last week with 135mph winds. Last 
year's Gilbert, with winds reaching 180mph, is the most powerful hurricane recorded and 
seems the upper limit with current ocean temperatures. But if seas warm up 3-6 degrees, 
winds could be 25% higher with 50% more destructive force. Hugo demonstrated the 
effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the 
Gulf Stream. The hurricane intensity scale may have to be raised to 6.</SUM>

The low number of deaths from powerful Hurricane Hugo can be credited to residents' 
healthy respect for forecasters' warnings. The storm caused billions in damage and 
claimed 17 lives in South Carolina. Only two died in the Charleston area, which bore the 
brunt of Hugo's 135mph winds. 18,000 thousand endangered residents went into shelters 
and tens of thousands evacuated inland, heading up I26 toward Columbia. The last big 
storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979. Several big storms have 
threatened since then but veered away. Officials worried that Charlestonians wouldn't 
heed warnings about Hugo since there had been so many false alarms.</SUM>

State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600 
million in claims from Hurricane Hugo, making it the most expensive storm ever for the 
insurance industry. Property damage escalated because Hugo scored a direct hit on 
Charleston and then veered northwest. Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5 
million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Reinsurers, who share risk in exchange for part 
of the premiums, and spread their own risk over many companies, will pick up much of 
the costs.  The billions paid out this year because of Hugo and other catastrophes will 
cause insurance firms to raise prices -- good news for companies and shareholders.</SUM>

Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and Caribbean last 
week, will reduce several insurers' third-quarter earnings. American International Group, 
which insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean, and the Carolina coast, 
expects losses between $35 and $45 million. St. Paul Cos. said the pretax cost of Hugo 
shouldn't exceed $50 million. Cigna Corp.'s third-quarter per-share earnings could drop 
50-65 cents a share. State Farm's Fire & Casualty unit estimates $400 million in 
payments in South Carolina. Payments in North Carolina and Virginia will bring the total 
to $500 million, more than three times its 1983 record payout of $165 million for 
Hurricane Alicia.</SUM>
