In September 1989, Category 4 Hurricane Hugo, with 135mph winds, damaged the 
eastern Caribbean then hit South Carolina, where coastal residents fled inland or into 
shelters. 17 Carolinians were killed. Satellites, computers, and reconnaissance planes 
helped forecasters monitor Hugo's progress. Insurance claims broke records. The 
greenhouse effect could raise future storms' destructive power by 50%.</SUM>
