An explosion rocked the battleship Iowa today, killing 47 sailors. The explosion occurred 
in a gun turret as a 16-inch gun was being fired during a training exercise about 330 miles 
NE of Puerto Rico. The Iowa, in no danger of sinking, headed back to Roosevelt Roads 
Naval Base after the crew extinguished the fire that broke out. The aircraft carrier Coral 
Sea came to assist. The Iowa dates from WWII and was put back into service in 1982. Its 
guns are original equipment. Gun operation requires 60-70 men, with 20-30 in the turret 
and others below sending up shells and 110-pound bags of gunpowder.</SUM>

Naval investigators boarded the battleship Iowa to find out the cause of Wednesday's gun 
explosion during a training exercise. They discarded the theory that red-hot debris left in 
a gun's breech by earlier rounds sparked the blast, because none of No. 2 turret's guns 
had been fired. All casualties were at the turret's top. Eleven men escaped from powder 
magazines at its base. No eyewitnesses survived. A moratorium was placed on firing 16-
inch guns. The bodies of the 47 sailors killed were flown to the military mortuary at 
Dover AFB.  President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday in Norfolk.</SUM>

Investigators' search for the cause of Wednesday's explosion aboard the battleship Iowa  
is hampered by the absence of eyewitnesses. All who were in No. 2 turret's gun house 
where the explosion occurred were killed. The explosion followed the order to load and 
prepare a gun for firing, and probably involved the sacks of gunpowder that are rammed 
into a gun after it is loaded with a shell. A moratorium was placed on firing 16-inch guns. 
Former Iowa-class commander Adm. Richard Milligan heads the investigation. Bodies of 
the casualties -- one officer and 46 enlisted men -- were sent to Dover AFB, site of the 
military's largest mortuary.</SUM>

The 16-inch guns on 1942 Iowa-class ships are criticized as archaic, dangerous 
technology unfit for the nuclear missile age. They are the only guns in the Navy that still 
use bagged powder -- packed in silk bags and ignited by an electric spark. In newer guns, 
powder is packed in metal containers. Missiles have integrated propellants. The 
battleships themselves, ordered out of mothballs and upgraded during the Reagan military 
buildup, are said to have outlived their purpose.  The Navy says ships and guns are still 
useful. An explosion killed 47 aboard the Iowa on Wednesday while a turret crew loaded 
gunpowder for target practice.</SUM>

The battleship Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico Friday under its own power, 
following an explosion on board that killed 47. Investigators interviewed crewmen and 
reviewed a videotape of the explosion made by an officer to record the firing of the big 
guns. Reportedly, deaths in the gun turret's upper chamber resulted from the explosion 
and fire while those in lower levels were from suffocation when the blast sucked all the 
oxygen out of the spaces. After extinguishing the fire, crew removed shells and powder 
from two other gun barrels in the turret. Senate Armed Services Committee will hold 
hearings on the explosion.</SUM>

Crowds gathered on Norfolk's waterfront Friday for a memorial after Wednesday's 
explosion aboard the Iowa. President Bush will attend a ceremony for crew and family 
members at Norfolk Naval Base Monday. The exact cause of the explosion may never be 
known because of the devastation, but investigators looking for clues studied a videotape 
made by an officer to record firing of the big guns. Deaths in upper turret chambers were 
from the explosion and fire while those at lower levels were due to suffocation when the 
blast sucked out oxygen. Crewmen removed shells and powder from two other guns in 
the turret after the fire was extinguished.</SUM>

Pathology exams  requested by the Navy have begun at Dover AFB on the sailors killed 
in an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa. Afterward, the sailors are being sent to their 
hometowns for burial. Crew on the Navy's three other battleships particularly felt the loss 
of comrades, as well as a connection with sailors who served on the same ships in WWII. 
The Iowa is expected at Norfolk this afternoon. Six investigators aboard the ship are 
searching for clues to the blast. Crew in upper chambers of the gun turret died instantly in 
the explosion, while those in lower levels suffocated as the blast siphoned off oxygen.</SUM>

The battleship Iowa was welcomed back to Norfolk Naval Base on Sunday by 3000 silent 
family and friends. Sailors with black arm bands lined the rails. Two of the 11 crew 
members who survived the explosion that killed 47 stood on the blackened No.2 turret, 
with full crews on the other two. Media were kept from families and crew. A video of the 
explosion was released on Sunday. The still-open gun breech, and flame and gases 
reaching lower decks, suggest the explosion occurred while powder was in transit from a 
powder hoist to the gun. The four battleships will stay in service.</SUM>

A 7-member team of Navy investigators, including former battleship commander Rear 
Adm. Milligan and gunnery experts, will look at possible human or mechanical errors as 
causes of the explosion aboard the battleship Iowa that killed 47. The investigation will 
be complex because there were no witnesses. The explosion damaged only the inside of 
the turret. The gun's breech was open and undamaged with the projectile still present, 
indicating the explosion occurred while powder was being transferred from a powder 
hoist to the gun. Flame and hot gases reached the lowest deck, indicating the hoist was 
not yet sealed. A video of the blast was released Sunday.</SUM>

At a memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station Monday for the 47 Battleship Iowa 
crewmen who perished in an explosion, President Bush spoke to 6000 mourners crowded 
into a hangar. Outside 2000 listened on loudspeakers. 45 victims' families attended. 500 
Iowa crewmen were blocked by traffic and Bush security. Iowa commander Capt. Fred 
Moosally praised the turret's gun crew as the best on the ship. The guns had been 
thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident. The surviving crew in the turret's 
powder magazine, waiting for the gun to fire, evacuated when no one answered the 
interior communications link.</SUM>
