An explosion in a battleship Iowa gun turret on April 19, 1989 during a training exercise 
killed 47. Investigators say the explosion occurred while gunpowder was in transit. In 
Norfolk, thousands welcomed the Iowa home and President Bush spoke at a memorial 
service. Critics say the WWII-era 16-inch guns are outdated and dangerous.</SUM>
