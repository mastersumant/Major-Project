An explosion in the battleship Iowa's No.2 turret on Wednesday, April 19, 1989, during a 
training exercise NE of Puerto Rico, killed 47. Naval investigators concluded the 
explosion occurred while gunpowder was in transit from a powder hoist. Thousands 
welcomed the Iowa home to Norfolk on Sunday, with sailors with black arm bands lining 
the ship's rails and surviving guncrew members standing atop the blackened No.2 turret. 
On Monday, President Bush spoke to mourners at a Norfolk memorial service. A 
moratorium was placed on firing the WWII-era 16-inch guns, which are criticized as 
outdated and dangerous. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on 
the explosion.</SUM>
