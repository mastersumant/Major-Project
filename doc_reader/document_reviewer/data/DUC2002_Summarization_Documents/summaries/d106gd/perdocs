Unidentified assailants attacked the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, killing a baby 
girl and injuring her parents. Nelson Mandela was close to the family, was not in the 
home at the time of the incident.  Given the family's connection to Mandela, police could 
not say if the attack was deliberate or the result of random violence. Black townships 
have been hit by factional fighting between African national Congress members and the 
Zulus of the Inkatha group.  Mandela, who was released from prison after 27 years, for 
opposing the white South African government is negotiating with President de Klerk to 
end apartheid.</SUM>

World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement of Nelson Mandela's impending 
release from prison.  Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally 
isolated South Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of 
pressure on the white-led government.  In 1986, the European Community banned many 
imports from South Africa and barred new investment in the country.  British 
Commonwealth leaders said that the South African government must guarantee 
Mandela's safety and the Commonwealth must sustain its pressure against apartheid. 
President Bush and leaders in Europe, the Soviet Union, the Middle East and Africa also 
hailed the decision.</SUM>

A representative of the African National Congress said the South African government 
would soon release Nelson Mandela from prison.  Mandela, 70, was jailed for life 27 
years ago for conspiring to overthrow the government of South Africa.  He was recently 
transferred from prison to hospital for treatment of tuberculosis.  The ANC is fighting to 
end white-minority rule in South Africa.  The release may be an attempt to win 
international support for the South African government. A South African government 
source indicated the rumors of Mandela's release were orchestrated by the anti-apartheid 
movement to pressure the government.  Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial 
separation.</SUM>

A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting Northwestern to award an honorary 
degree to jailed South African nationalist leader, Nelson Mandela has raised objections 
from some faculty and students.  The degree is to be accepted by South African 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Boston at a benefit dinner.  Some faculty and students, 
including many blacks, say no effort was made to include them.  South Africa's white-
minority government says it will free Mandela, only if he renounces the use of violence 
by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country.  Northwestern has not yet

Winnie Mandela, wife of African National Congress leader, Nelson Mandela was 
convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to six years in prison. Her husband has been 
working since his release from prison 15 months ago, to end the murderous conflict 
between black political factions.  He has loyally defended her innocence, but ANC 
radicals may use the conviction to turn members against Mandela's policy of peace and 
negotiation and move him aside.  But both de Klerk and Mandela and their followers 
have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa.  The next step is 
formal negotiations.</SUM>

New York City mayor, Dinkins, warned Jewish groups against protesting the visit of 
South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, saying the visit might insult the 
black community. He also asked Jewish leaders to dissuade more radical groups from 
disrupting the visit. Jewish leaders are concerned that Mandela has embraced Yassar 
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and has compared the 
Palestinian struggle to that of black South Africans.  They want him to clarify his position 
on Israel and some have said if he does not make a strong statement supporting Israel, 
they would hold demonstrations.</SUM>

Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in South Africa for most of his 
life.  At 26, he joined the African National Congress, which soon became the force 
behind black protests and civil disobedience against the government policy of apartheid.  
In 1960 the ANC was outlawed and in 1964 Mandela was convicted of conspiracy to 
overthrow the government and sentenced to life in prison.  Although in prison, he was a 
powerful symbol of government oppression of blacks and refused release in 1986 until 
the government dismantled apartheid.   On February 11, 1990 he was finally released.</SUM>
