Saturday Manila newspapers quoted Teodoro Benigno, President Corazon Aquinoi's press 
secretary, saying Mrs. Aquino told Swiss lawyers that Ferdinand Marcos will be allowed 
to return to the Philippines so that he can be tried for stealing billions of dollars. 

The Philippine government said it will file criminal charges against former President 
Marcos, claiming he stole up to $10 billion of government funds. Mrs. Aquino, however, 
has previously refused to let Marcos return from exile in Hawaii, citing security concerns. 
Philippine law prohibits trial in absentia.

Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money that Marcos allegedly 
placed in Swiss banks.</SUM>

President Corazon Aquino on Friday refuse to allow her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, 
to return home to die and won't permit him to be buried here despite an appeal from his 
wife.

The 71-year-old Marcos is in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from 
renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure. Mrs. Marcos' appeal was broadcast by a pro-
Marcos radio station.

Meanwhile, pro-Marcos leaders warned the former president's death in exile would 
trigger demonstrations. Chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the armed forces were 
prepared to block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble.</SUM>

President Corazon Aquino said today her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, cannot return 
home to die nor will she permit him to be buried here despite an appeal from his wife.

The 71-year-old Marcos is in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from 
renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure. Mrs. Marcos' appeal was broadcast by a pro-

Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising that toppled his administration 
and forced him into exile in Hawaii.

Today, the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to 1,084.53 from Thursday's 
close of 1,102.97. Traders said rumors of Marcos' death triggered a selling wave.</SUM>

President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not permit 
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in the Philippines, despite an appeal 
from his wife, Imelda, that he be allowed to return. Marcos, 71, was reported to be 
hospitalized in very critical condition in Honolulu, where he has lived in exile since his 
ouster in 1986.

Despite charges that Marcos stole billions of dollars from the government, the former 
president still has a significant following here. Marcos supporters said they will march 
through the capital today to support his demand that he be allowed to die in the 
Philippines.</SUM>

In a meeting Monday with West German government and industrial leaders, including 
President Richard von Weizaecker, Philippine President Corazon Aquino asked for 
economic assistance. She said that though the Philippines' debt was projected to increase 
to $29 billion by December, much of that was stolen by ousted dictator Marcos. Calling 
for debt relief and investment, Mrs. Aquino said that under her leadership the country's 
growth rate had improved from minus10 percent to plus 6.7 percent. During an evening 
state banquet, Weizaecker assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European 
Economic Community plans for 1992 will not prevent trade with other countries.</SUM>

Thursday night about 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better 
Philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles in 
support of the military coup attempt unfolding in their homeland. Some of the protesters 
entered the consulate offices and confronted a coalition of four Los Angeles, pro-Aquino 
Filipino groups holding a press conference. After some minutes of shouting between the 
Aquino supporters and the anti-government protesters, the protesters departed and order 
was restored. 

The coup attempt is being led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan.

Present at the LA press conference was Andrea Aquino, niece of assassinated Marcos 
opponent Benigno Aquino, Cory Aquino's husband.</SUM>

Saturday Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador Laurel refused to 
condemn the armed insurrection in his country and predicted the fighting may become 
civil war if rebel reinforcements arrive from other islands. 

Laurel broke with Aquino shortly after they took office in 1986. As head of the 
opposition Nacionalista Party, he has criticized Aquino frequently.

Laurel criticized Aquino for asking for U.S. military assistance. Friday, U.S. officials said 
Phantom jets patrolled rebel aircraft to keep them grounded but did not fire. Laurel 
claims the U.S. aircraft destroyed Philippine air force facilities near Sangley Point and 
killed civilians near Camp Aquinaldo.</SUM>

Thursday Secretary-designate Florencio Abad, whose nomination was opposed by the 
pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party, resigned. His resignation 
reinforces suspicion among liberals that Mrs. Aquino is not as committed to social 
change as they expected when she took power in 1986. 

Abad's difficulties began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of 
government land to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park, believing the land 
should be distributed instead to peasants. Abad's stand, alarmed landowners in Congress, 
and lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino party 
blocked his appointment through eight hearings.</SUM>

President Corazon Aquino today reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to 
negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged 
coup attempts. Mrs. Aquino also invited her most outspoken critic Sen. Juan Enrile to 
join the talks. Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who fired him as 
defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in November 1986. 

No one has claimed responsibility for the explosions that occur almost daily in Manila. 
The Government blames them on Communist rebels who have repeatedly tried to topple 
Aquino.</SUM>

President Aquino used small bombers and artillery to end a rebellion led by renegade 
army Col. Alexander Noble on Mindanao, countering charges that her government is 
indecisive. The Oct. 4-6 uprising never spread to the military underground on other 
islands.

Aquino has survived two major coup attempts and several aborted military mutinies. 
Most ended in standoffs or dragged on for days because military leaders were reluctant to 
order troops to fire on other soldiers.

Noble's rebellion coincided with the release of a government report that concluded coup 
attempts will probably continue -- but unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future.</SUM>
