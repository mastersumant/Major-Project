President Corazon Aquino used military firepower to end the military led rebellion on 
Mindanao. The Oct. 4-6 uprising never spread to other islands. Aquino has survived two 
major coup attempts and several military mutinies. The current rebellion is the latest of 
several military mutinies. In August Aquino reversed a long-held policy and said she was 
willing to negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerillas and former soldiers who have 
staged coup attempts. In December 1989 a confrontation between pro-coup supporters 
and Aquino supporters occurred at the Philippine consulate in Los Angeles.

Aquino's government has also had its political controversies. Her opposition to the 
nomination of Secretary-designate Abad raised doubts about her commitment to social 
reform. In 1989, her Vice President refused to condemn the insurrection that was then 
unfolding.

Aquino rose to power in 1986 after dictator Ferdinand Marcos, accused of stealing 
billions of government funds, was ousted. June1988 news stories quoted sources saying 
Aquino would allow Marcos to return to the Philippines to stand trial, but a year later she 
stated the critically ill Marcos could not return to die, nor could he be buried in the 
Philippines.

Aquino traveled to West German in 1989 seeking economic assistance.</SUM>
