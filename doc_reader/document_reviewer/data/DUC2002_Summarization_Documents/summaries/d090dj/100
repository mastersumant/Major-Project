With military firepower, President Aquino ended the Oct. 4-6 uprising. She has 
survived two major coup attempts and several mutinies. Recently, in a reversal of policy, 
Aquino said she would negotiate with Communist guerillas. 

Aquino's, political controversies include her opposition to the nomination of agrarian 
reform leader Secretary-designate Abad, and her Vice President's refusal to condemn an 
insurrection in 1989.

Aquino succeeded Marcos who was accused of stealing billions from the government. In 
1989 she refused to let Marcos, critically ill in Hawaii, to reenter the country or to allow 
him to be buried in the Philippines.</SUM>
