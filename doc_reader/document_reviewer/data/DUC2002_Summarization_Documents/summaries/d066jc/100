Sam Walton relied on his personality, hard work and a willingness to adopt new business 
practices to build Wal-Mart into the country's largest discount retailer. This made him the 
country's richest man, but he continued to live a simple life. Identification as the richest 
man made him uncomfortable. 

He was criticized for anti-union policies and causing the failure of small town businesses 
where he located his stores. Walton often visited his workers and kept them happy. 

Shortly before his death in 1992 Walton wrote a folksy autobiography. There is also a 
"scholarly study" on his business.</SUM>
