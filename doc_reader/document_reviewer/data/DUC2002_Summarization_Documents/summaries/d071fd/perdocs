William Wegman's two Weimaraners serve as both companions and artist models to the 
artist.  The breed is affectionate and can hold a pose.  The mother-daughter dogs live with 
Wegman in his home, a former Orthodox synagogue on Manhattan's Lower East Side.  
The 47-year-old artist began his association with Weimaraners in 1970 when he acquired 
a puppy, Man Ray, for $35 dollars.  He quickly learned that the breed makes perfect 
subjects.  When he died at the age of 11, Man Ray was world famous.  One of Wegman's 
current dogs, Fay Ray, is now a familiar face both with artists and among children who 
watch Sesame Street.</SUM>

20,000 attended Israel's dog-of-the year contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.
The winner a feisty boxer beat out 800 other contestants representing more than 50 
different breeds.  The event was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club based in Brussels 
and had judges from the Netherlands, South Africa, Italy and Britain.  Although the 
competition was billed as an international event, organizers conceded there were few if 
any contestants from abroad.  This was in contrast to 1987 prior to the uprising known as 
the intefadeh, when scores of foreign competitors participated.  Within Israel, the event 
briefly outshone both the intefadeh and general election.</SUM>
