Andrei D. Sakharov, 66, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. He was exiled to Gorky for 
seven years after criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, returning to Moscow with 
his wife Yelena Bonner in December 1986. Sakharov belongs to the Academy of 
Sciences and helped create the Soviet hydrogen bomb. He vocally supports Gorbachev's 
reform campaign but calls for political prisoner liberation and human rights 
improvements. Past Soviet reports called the couple traitors, accusing Bonner of 
marrying Sakharov for his money, and saying they lived in luxury amid scandals. Now 
press says they live simply. Sakharov always does the dishes. His apartment is a mecca 
for Soviets seeking his aid.</SUM>

Andrei D. Sakharov, brilliant physicist and prominent 1970s dissident, won the 1975 
Nobel Peace Prize. After criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, without trial he 
was exiled to the closed city of Gorky from January 1980 to December 1986. Sakharov, 
66, and his wife live frugally in their two-room, seventh-floor Moscow apartment, a 
mecca for people seeking aid. Sakharov supports Gorbachev's reform program but wants 
speedier progress in human rights and a nuclear testing ban. On January 15th he listed 
200 political prisoners. Sakharov's 1975 statement of his views was not published 
domestically. Media which once branded him a traitor now tries to undo harm.</SUM>

Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov began a two-week US visit Sunday. He will 
visit relatives, undergo medical tests, and promote the new International Foundation for 
Survival and Development of Humanity, to which he belongs. Sakharov helped form the 
1970s Soviet dissident movement, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and was exiled 
internally for seven years after criticizing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Gorbachev 
allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986. Some of Sakharov's statements 
have since appeared in press, including his opposition to some elements of Gorbachev 
reforms and to Reagan's Star Wars program. His presentation of 200 political prisoners' 
names and his US visit went unreported.</SUM>

In New York Thursday, Andrei D. Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident movement, 
received the 1973 Human Rights Award from the International League for Human 
Rights. Sakharov helped found an affiliate group, the Moscow Human Rights Committee, 
in 1971.  Reception guests included Elie Wiesel, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Barbara 
Walters. Less than two years ago, the 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was freed by 
Gorbachev from internal exile in Gorky, where he was banished in 1980 for opposing 
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Sakharov's first US visit began Sunday. He will visit 
relatives, the White House, receive medical treatment, and meet with the International 
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity.</SUM>

Soviet physicists at Moscow's prestigious Lebedev Institute voted 1543 to 22 in secret 
ballot Friday to nominate 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov to 
parliament, two days after the Academy of Sciences rejected him and other reformers as 
candidates. Whether 67-year-old Sakharov's name will appear on the March 26 ballot is 
uncertain. Sakharov outlined his reform plan for freedom of movement and association, a 
multiparty system, a publicly-controlled KGB, and the convergence of communism and 
capitalism. Sakharov publicly supports Gorbachev but is concerned with slow, uneven  
reforms. He acted as unofficial envoy to the Transcaucasus last month, and called for the 
release of imprisoned Karabakh Committee members.</SUM>

1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of 
Sciences Monday to reject the leadership's slate for the new Soviet legislature in 
Tuesday's voting. The slate included old-guard managers of scientific institutions and not 
the 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, even though he was 
nominated by 60 research institutes. Many scientists object to the slate for Sunday's 
election. Sakharov was nominated for a seat in the new 2250-member Congress of 
People's Deputies by several geographic districts, but refused the nominations and fought 
for an Academy of Sciences seat. Sakharov supporters hope to deny all nominees a 
majority and force new nominations.</SUM>

Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet 
Congress of People's Deputies, two years after being released from seven years of 
internal exile. On Sunday, he praised the Soviet's new course in world affairs, 
demonstrated by withdrawal from Afghanistan, but criticized internal measures 
restricting freedom of speech. He likened them to measures against dissidents like 
himself in the 1970s and 1980s and called use of toxic gas against demonstrators in 
Soviet Georgia anti-democratic. He said reforms of the old centralized system were too 
slow. People were losing interest because they couldn't buy anything. The country was 
on the brink of economic catastrophe.</SUM>

Andrei D. Sakharov, 68-year-old physicist, human rights activist, and winner of the 1975 
Nobel Peace Prize, died Thursday of an apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment.  
His widow is Yelena Bonner. World leaders praised him as a pioneer who helped change 
Soviet society, a force for freedom who outlived his persecutors and saw the liberty he 
championed take root throughout Eastern Europe. He was once a national hero for his 
work on the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled for his uncompromising stands for 
human freedom. Gorbachev freed him from seven years of internal exile. The European 
Parliament gave Sakharov's name to its Human Rights Prize.</SUM>

Andrei D. Sakharov, 68, died Thursday in his study, hours after urging creation of formal 
parliamentary opposition to break the party's stranglehold on power. Soviet leaders 
eulogized him as an honest, sincere man who suffered great injustice. An obituary signed 
by officials and scholars appeared in Pravda and emphasized the importance of 
Sakharov's 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. At age 32 Sakharov became the youngest member of 
the Academy of Sciences and joined the group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb. 
He realized its danger and urged limited production and testing. Breshnev exiled 
Sakharov in 1980 for criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Gorbachev allowed 
his return to Moscow in December 1986.</SUM>

45,000 grievers filed past the body of Andrei D. Sakharov -- physicist, Nobel Peace Prize 
winner, human rights advocate, legislator, and his country's conscience. Sakharov, 68, 
died Thursday of an apparent heart attack. Sunday began two days of memorial 
ceremonies.  Moscow News published a special edition devoted to the activist, including 
a speech he delivered hours before his death saying the Soviet hierarchy was leading the 
country to catastrophe. Pravda published a virtual public apology to Sakharov, once 
ostracized and exiled. Sakharov had two children from his first marriage; two with his 
widow Yelena Bonner, who was his constant companion and fellow human rights 
activist; and four grandchildren.</SUM>
