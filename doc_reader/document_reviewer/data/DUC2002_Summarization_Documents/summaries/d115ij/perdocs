Rain in the India-Nepal border region where a major earthquake struck Sunday is 
hampering rescue efforts. Landslides block many roads, railroad tracks are sunk in mud, 
and bridges over rain swollen rivers are cracked. Officials in Nepal say more than 497 
people died. Authorities in India report 200 deaths in Bihar, but news reports say 400 
died. Officials in both countries expect the death toll to climb once reports arrive from
