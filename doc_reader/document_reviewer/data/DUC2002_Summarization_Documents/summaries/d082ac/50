Andrei Sakharov died in December 1989. The Soviet physicist helped develop the 
hydrogen bomb, but was better known for winning the  Nobel Peace Prize. His advocacy 
of human rights and criticism of the Kremlin resulted in a seven-year exile. His obituary 
constituted a public apology for the treatment afforded him.</SUM>
