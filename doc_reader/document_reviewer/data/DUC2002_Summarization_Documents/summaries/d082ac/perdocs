The latest issue of the Soviet News included a sensitive article on Andrei Sakharov and 
his wife, Yelena Bonner. In the past the state-run media has branded the dissident couple 
as traitors. The article made only indirect mention of Sakharov's forced exile in the 
closed city of Gorky. He was exiled for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
Sakharov now supports Gorbachev, but wants all political prisoners released. 

Sakharov is a member of the prestigious Academy of Sciences and a 1975 Nobel Peace 
Prize winner. He and Yelena live frugally in Moscow.</SUM>

Andrei Sakharov was banished without trial to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980. 
He was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986. Now, in May 1988, the Moscow 
News has published an article that makes a clear attempt to refute some of the charges 
made by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media against Sakharov and his wife.

Sakharov has supported Gorbachev's reforms, but has pressed Gorbachev for speedier 
progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights. He recently handed Gorbachev 
a list of 200 people who were imprisoned for their opinions.</SUM>

Andrei Sakharov's visit to the United States has gone virtually unreported in Moscow, 
with only a radio broadcast saying he had voiced opposition to the "Star Wars" program. 
Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the statement in a Boston news conference. Sakharov 
is a member of the International Foundation for Survival and Development of Humanity. 
Tass reported that the organization held a meeting, but did not mention Sakharov.

Sakharov is a celebrity in the West since he helped start the Soviet dissident movement in 
the 1970s. He is visiting relatives and undergoing medical testing in the United States.</SUM>

Soviet physicists, in a rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, voted on 
Friday to nominate Andrei Sakharov to be a candidate in the March parliamentary 
elections. The overwhelming vote, taken in secrecy, came only two days after the 
Governing Board of the Academy of Sciences rejected Sakharov's candidacy. 

The vote was more an expression of respect for Sakharov than a specific endorsement of 
his political views. Sakharov used the occasion to outline a detailed program that would 
transform the Soviet Union. Complicated voting procedures still make it uncertain that 
Sakharov's name will appear on the ballot.</SUM>

Andrei Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the 
Congress of People's Deputies. He refused those nominations, and in a Monday speech, 
urged members of the Academy of Sciences to reject the leadership's slate of candidates. 
The listing of candidates does not include Sakharov and several other candidates who 
advocate reform.

Supporters of Sakharov characterize the Academy's leadership as a collection of old-
guard managers of scientific institutions. They want the Academy to start all over and 
produce a new slate in a vote scheduled for Tuesday.</SUM>

O Sunday Andrei Sakharov spoke in Milan to the Congress of the Italian Socialist Party. 
He said the Soviet Union was on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms were 
moving too slowly. Last month he was elected to the new Soviet Congress of People's 
Deputies, a little more than two years after his release from internal exile.

The new course in international affairs, as exemplified by the withdrawal from 
Afghanistan, please Sakharov, but economic conditions worry him. He was also critical 
of new legislation on personal responsibility, and the government's heavy hand in 
suppressing dissidents in Georgia.</SUM>

Andrei Sakharov, the 68 year-old scientist and human rights activist, died Thursday of an 
apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment. Colleagues in the Soviet Congress 
observed a minute of silence in honor of the man who was considered a national hero for 
his work on the hydrogen bomb, and later reviled for his stand on human rights. President 
Gorbachev praised him as a "man of conviction and sincerity".

Tributes poured in from around the world. President Bush, Prime Minister Thatcher and 
Lech Walesa were among those honoring the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.</SUM>

Sakharov's obituary was signed by President Gorbachev, five other politburo members, 
and fifty other leading officials and scholars. It was published in Pravda. Such obituaries 
are reserved for favored public officials, and Pravda emphasized Sakharov's importance 
by printing the decree on the funeral commission on the front page.

The obituary praised Sakharov as a man of honesty and sincerity. This amounted to a 
public apology for the 1989 exile ordered by President Brezhnev. Gorbachev now blames 
Brezhnev for allowing stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system. 
Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December1986 and ended the exile.</SUM>

Sunday was the first day of memorial ceremonies for Andrei Sakharov. As many as 
70,000 mourners viewed his body in the Youth Palace. Sub-zero temperatures prevailed, 
but the mourners waited in a line that stretched a mile from the Palace. It was a vast 
outpouring of grief for a man once ostracized and sent into exile. It was as if the populace 
was apologizing for being late in recognizing his contributions. He will be buried on 
Monday.

Yelena Bonner, his widow and fellow activist, said that she hopes his writings will finally 
be made widely available in his homeland.</SUM>
