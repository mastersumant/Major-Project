Gilbert is now a tropical storm, bringing heavy rains, flooding, and mudslides to areas of 
northeastern Mexico.  Gilbert at one time was the most intense hurricane recorded and 
brought havoc to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and Mexico's 
Yucatan Peninsula.  Gilbert's center avoided Texas, although it spawned tornadoes along 
the coast.</SUM>
