northern Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  Severe thunderstorms hit in Arkansas, 
Ohio, and Kentucky.  Peru, Indiana reported the heaviest rainfall.  Other storms, with

Recovery efforts continue in Huntsville, Alabama, where a tornado carved a swath of 
destruction, killing 17, injuring 463 and leaving 1,000 homeless.  This tornado was one in 
a series that struck in at least seven Midwestern and Southern states.  The storm system is 
now moving through the Mid-Atlantic states toward New England.  The tornado struck 
Huntsville with virtually no warning as the evening rush hour approached.  Although an 
elementary school was hit, most of the dead were in apartments, stores, or cars.  Downed 
power lines and blocked roads continue to afflict the area.  The nearby Redstone Arsenal 
and NASA's Marshall facility were not damaged.</SUM>

A powerful storm system brought heavy thunderstorms, tornados, and strong winds to the 
Northeast on Thursday.  Tornados were reported in New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, and 
New York.  Strong thunderstorms hit in a broad area.  Seven children were killed and 18 
injured when a wall collapsed near Newburgh, New York.  A large variation in 
temperatures has made this front, the same one that hit the South and the Ohio valley 
yesterday, extremely strong.  A tornado watch remains for northeast New York state and 
much of Vermont and New Hampshire.  Snow is following the front and cold weather is 
expected in the Southeast.</SUM>

Marilyn Quayle, wife of the Vice President, praised the heroism of the residents of 
tornado-ravaged Huntsville, Alabama, when she visited on Saturday.  She was 
accompanied by the state's governor and two senators.  State and federal officials 
promised to do whatever is necessary, even though national disaster funds are already 
low because of the California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.  A federal official asked 
people to be patient, while the thousands of relief requests are processed.  He hopes to 
have checks out in seven to 10 days.  State officials said the government could not carry 
the whole burden and urged charitable contributions.</SUM>
