A powerful cold front moved through the eastern half of the United States on November 
15 and 16, spawning tornados, violent thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall.  Thirteen states 
reported deaths, injuries, or damage.  Hardest hit was Huntsville, Alabama, where a 
tornado leveled a shopping district, apartment development, and elementary school.  
Seventeen were killed, 463 injured, and 1000 left homeless.  Damages were estimated at 
$100 million.  President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area.  Marilyn Quayle and 
Alabama's governor and senators toured the area on November 18.  This storm front 
killed nine others, including seven school children in Newburgh, New York.</SUM>
