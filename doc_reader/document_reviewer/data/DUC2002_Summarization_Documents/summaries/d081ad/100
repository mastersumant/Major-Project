Miners throughout the world have used strikes not only to achieve economic gains, but 
also to gain greater control over their industries and to achieve political ends.  Miners in 
Poland, Romania and in every region of the Soviet Union have struck for higher wages 
and better living conditions and also and for more local control. In Poland, miners struck 
for legalization of Solidarity.  In South Africa miners struck for better wages and working 
conditions and in the U.S. miners walked of f the job in sympathy for fellow miners in a
