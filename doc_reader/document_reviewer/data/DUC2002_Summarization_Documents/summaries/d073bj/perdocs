Clark AFB, Philippines, was evacuated today after gases, ash and rock spewed from 
Mount Pinatubo located 10 miles from the U.S. base. Philippine Institute of Vulcanology 
and Seismology Director Raymundo Punongbayan warned that bigger eruptions would 
follow.  Subic Bay naval base will house the nearly 15,000 evacuees. Fifteen hundred 
troops remained at Clark to provide security. Since Pinatubo began erupting last week, 
Philippine officials have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces. Pinatubo 
is in the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific. Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring, 
erupted a week ago, killing 38 people.</SUM>

A cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above Mount Pinatubo today. The 
Philippine volcano erupted Saturday after six centuries of dormancy. According to Peter 
Lipman, a Menlo Park U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist, a major eruption could 
occur causing death and destruction from hellish avalanches of hot ash. Lipman is in 
contact with five USGS scientists who remained at Clark AFB which was evacuated 
along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano. Thus far, ash has blown away 
from the base, but the summer monsoon weather pattern will reverse the pattern.</SUM>

Five explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo today between 08:40 a.m. and 11:05 p.m. 
causing residents of nearby Angeles and the remaining personnel on Clark AFB to flee 
the area. Most of Clark's 15,000 residents were relocated to Subic Bay naval base on 
Monday. About 19,000 Filipinos have also departed provinces near the volcano, and 
officials said more would be evacuated after today's eruptions. The first fatality related to 
the eruption occurred today when a car collided with a bus on an ash-slick road. 
Seismologists said that more severe eruptions could come later. President Aquino briefly 
visited refugee centers near Angeles.</SUM>

Mount Pinatubo erupted late Wednesday and early today forcing another evacuation of 
Clark AFB. Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Director Raymundo 
Punongbayan said more eruptions, at least as severe, are expected within three days.

Most of the 16,000 Americans on Clark departed Monday. Those evacuated today were 
security volunteers. U.S. officials will not comment on whether nuclear weapons are 
stored at Clark, but they deny the suggestion that molten rock falling on base weapons 
depots would create a radiation danger.

Thus far, two fatalities have been attributed to the eruption. Over nineteen thousand 
people have been evacuated from nearby villages.</SUM>

Mount Pinatubo exploded today, hurling ash and gas over 12 miles high. Heavy rains 
drenched the area, raising fears of catastrophic mudflows.

Thus far, at least four people have died, 24 have been injured, and about 84,000 
evacuated since Pinatubo began erupting Sunday after six centuries of dormancy.

President Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that the U.S. had warned of 
possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark 
AFB which was abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000 Americans.

Foreign Secretary Manglapus said that the eruption should not effect current talks on new 
leases for Clark and Subic.</SUM>
