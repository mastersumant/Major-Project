The Conservatives are moving to replace party leader John Major and remove him as 
prime minister. In local elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered 
their worst defeat ever. The defeat put them in third place behind the Liberal Democrats 
and the Labor Party. This came as former Conservative members of Parliament 
announced that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats. Major is seen is indecisive 
and weak in his handling of foreign and domestic affairs. While calling for a return to 
basic values, his own cabinet has been rocked by scandal. Major has also reneged on 
campaign promises not to increase taxes.</SUM>

John Major, it seems, can be all things to all people. Recently, when asked how he had so 
much empathy with agriculture, Major told an interviewer for Farm Weekly that his 
father had been a farmer in 1910; 33 years before Major was born. Major also told an 
American audience in Pittsburgh that his father had worked there is a steel worker. 
Wanting to be all things to all people he can appeal to the pro-Europeans by saying he 
wants Britain to be at the heart of Europe while at the same time insulting the European 
Commission when appealing to an audience of Euro-skeptics.</SUM>

John Major was elected leader of the Conservative Party today. Endorsed by Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, Major will become prime minister. 
At 47, he will be the youngest prime minister since the 19th century. In a secret ballot 
election among Tory members of parliament, Major won 185 votes, two short of the 
majority needed to win. His opponents, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine with 
131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd with 56, conceded the election to Major, 
making a second ballot unnecessary. Major emerged as the possible heir apparent to 
Thatcher when she appointed him chancellor of the Exchequer in 1989.</SUM>

John Major's public image as a wimp may have changed following a candid interview 
with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor. Major used a variety of epitaphs to describe 
certain colleagues who are not his favorites. It is a change that comes too late. The 
Conservative majority in last year's general election in Christchurch turned into a victory 
for the Liberal Democrats in this year's by-election. In reality, the language of all 
politicians, including Major, changes when they speak in private. Gone are the crafted 
sentences as a certain saltiness creeps in and the politicians swear and joke.</SUM>

Just a year after winning the general election, a surprise to everyone, Mr. John Major 
enters the second year of his term as a deeply unpopular leader. The honeymoon 
following his victory was short lived and his past year has been marked by a number of 
controversies. These controversies include internal party differences over Europe, the 
debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the 
European Monetary System, as well as a deep and continuing recession. The recession 
has alienated many of his allies in the business community. Major is seen as a weak 
leader without a clear political agenda.</SUM>

John Major was elected to succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime minister Tuesday night 
by the Conservative party. Major fell two votes short of a majority but his two opponents 
quickly conceded defeat and Major was confirmed as the winner. Major succeeds 
following an initial challenge to party leadership by former Defense Secretary Michael 
Heseltine last week. When it became apparent that she could not defeat the Heseltine 
challenge, Mrs. Thatcher resigned in order to let someone from the Cabinet stand against 
Heseltine. Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, a race in 
which Thatcher endorsed Major.</SUM>

John Major continues to face leadership challenges as he enters the second year of his 
term. In an attempt to bolster his support, Cabinet ministers rallied behind Major 
yesterday, insisting there would be no leadership election in the fall. The public show of 
support did little to dispel doubts among Tory MPs about Major's ability to stay in office. 
Their doubts were confirmed in the findings of a national opinion poll held by the 
Independent On Sunday which indicated that Michael Heseltine was favorite to replace 
Major. Despite efforts to foster unity in the Conservative Party, Major's chances of 
surviving have shortened to 11/10 against him.</SUM>

At 47, John Major, the son of a circus performer and a high school drop out, has become 
Britain's 18th and youngest prime minister. Major was elected leader of the Conservative 
Party following the sudden resignation of Margaret Thatcher last week. Thatcher resigned 
following a leadership challenge by former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine. In the 
second round balloting following the resignation, Major received 185 votes, two short of 
the majority needed. His two opponents, Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 
quickly conceded to Major. Major's election is seen as ensuring the unity of the 
Conservative Party in the next general election.</SUM>

In a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf, Prime Minister John Major 
today announced that Iraqi troops have to withdraw completely from Kuwait. Major said 
that they will have to be removed forcibly if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to 
a peaceful withdrawal. Major rejected any idea of a partial pullback by Iraqi troops and 
compared the situation in Kuwait to that of a prison camp. Although Major is as 
unyielding as his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, he showed none of her abrasiveness. 
Major's remarks boded well for his talks at Camp David with President George Bush.</SUM>

In trying to brush aside recent differences with London, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
stressed Washington's special relationship with Britain. These remarks came as Clinton 
welcomed Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh where Major's grandfather and father 
once lived. Following the visit to Pittsburgh, Clinton and Major will return to the White 
House, where Major will spend the night, the first foreign head of state to do so since 
Clinton became president. High on the agenda for talks between the two men are the 
tragedy in Bosnia as well as Russia, Northern Ireland, and world trade. Clinton and Major 
will meet in June again during D-Day commemoration ceremonies.</SUM>
