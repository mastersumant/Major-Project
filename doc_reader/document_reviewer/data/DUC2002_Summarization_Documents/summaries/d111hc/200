most powerful battleship was scuttled off France in May 1941, and found in June 1944.

High winds prevailed when a Finnish freighter sank in the North Sea in September 1988. 
A 1989 scandal that involved Austrian politicians grew out of the mysterious sinking of 
the freighter Lucona in the Indian Ocean 12 years earlier.

The Ostwind, a yacht built for Hitler, came to an ignominious end off the coast of 
Florida. In the same month whales attacked and sank the American pleasure boat Sibonay 
off Costa Rica.

Korean vessel, fishing illegally in Argentine waters, was scuttled in May 1994 when 
apprehended by the Argentine Coast Guard.
