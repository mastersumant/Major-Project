An explosion at the Royal Marines School of Music in the southeastern coastal town of 
Deal killed eight people and injured 30. Up to 18 people were feared trapped in the 
rubble. The reason for the blast, which occurred at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks is 
not known but a forensic team from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad had been called

The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for an explosion, which leveled a 
military barracks and damaged nearby homes and left 11 people dead and 22 injured. The

Britons expressed anger and concern over the lax security procedures at British bases 
following the Friday IRA bombing at the Royal Marines Music School in Deal. That 
attack left 10 dead and 22 injured, 12 seriously.  The Royal Marines Music School is one 
of 30 bases in England employing private security firms. Considered a money saving 
measure, there were calls to review the policy. Because of the tighter security at bases 
considered to be at high risk, the IRA has turned its attention to bases they consider more 
vulnerable. The attack came after Prime Minister Thatcher's speech in Ulster, praising 
the Ulster Defense Regiment.</SUM>
