MGM studios art director Cedric Gibbons created Oscar, the Academy of Motion 
Pictures Arts and Sciences famous award, 60 years ago. Manufactured by the R.S. Owens 
Co., the gold plated metal statue weighs 8 pounds and stands 13 inches tall. According to 
Academy spokesman Bob Werden, the Academy holds all rights on the statue and 
reserves the right to buy back an Oscar before it is pawned. "All About Eve" (1950) is the  
most-nominated film (14). "Ben-Hur" (1959) is the most-awarded film (11). Walt Disney 
was the most-awarded person (32).</SUM>

In the 60-year history of the Academy Awards, there are numerous examples of 
Hollywood's highest achievers being overlooked. The latest casualties are directors 
James L. Brooks, whose movie "Broadcast News" won seven major nominations, 
including best picture, and Steven Spielberg whose movie "Empire of the Sun" received 
six nominations. 

Though Brooks has a Best Director trophy ("Terms of Endearment" (1984)), Spielberg 
has never been recognized with the coveted award. Last year the Academy appeared to 
make amends by presenting him with the Irving Thalberg award, an honorary award that 
was also given to other overlooked giants such as Hitchcock and DeMille.</SUM>

Oscar selection is being scrutinized as studios mount major promotional campaigns to 
influence the 4600 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
voters.

An Oscar nomination or victory has tremendous impact on a film's gross. (Over 70 
percent of the revenues for 1986's best picture came after the film was nominated.) 
Amidst the flood of advertisements and enticements, some Academy members 
acknowledge committee voting. Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the 
accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc. said that there is no guarantee that Academy 
members have actually filled out their own ballots.</SUM>

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently sought court protection for 
Oscar, its famous award, with mixed results. After The Collector's Book Store 
announced a February auction of the 1957 best-picture trophy, the Academy won a court 
order temporarily blocking future auctions. But, the Academy lost a copyright 
infringement suit against Houston International Film Festival in which it claimed that the 
festival's Lone Star Statuette was an Oscar clone.

These efforts against commercialization notwithstanding, Coca Cola Co.is stocking the 
limousines of celebrities attending this year's award ceremony. With the limousine doors 
open, the Coke logo will be clearly visible.</SUM>

The Walt Disney Co. filed a suit Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character. Disney 
claims it took action after the academy failed to publicly apologize for the use of the 
character. Bruce Davis, the academy's executive administrator, declined comment.

Eileen Bowman portrayed Snow White in a 10-minute song and dance routine that 
opened Wednesday night's awards ceremony.

Steve Silver created the Snow White character portrayed Wednesday. Though he has 
used it for 15 years in a musical, Disney has never sued him over the character in that 
production.</SUM>

At Wednesday's Academy Awards, "Rain Man" won four Oscars and "Dangerous 
Liaisons" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" each won three. Seven other films also each 
won one award. Ten movies split 17 awards, the most winners for one year this decade. 
Refreshingly, several winners came from films that were not box office smashes: Jodie 
Foster as best actress ("The Accused"); Geena Davis as best supporting actress ("The 
Accidental Tourist"); sound editing for "Bird;" and David Grusin's score of "The 
Milagro Beanfield War." 

The 1988 slate of films was a marked improvement over recent years and reflected an 
older, more demanding audience.</SUM>

Future Academy Award shows should take a cue from Spencer Tracy's acting technique, 
"less is better." Wednesday's show was too long (necessary to accommodate all the 
$375,000 30-second ads), had too many production numbers, and there were too many 
awards with meaning lost to the general public. The brightest moments of the 61st 
Awards came from Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Bob Hope, but they were too 
brief..Other observations on the show:

Most heartfelt acceptance: Dustin Hoffman
Most intelligent acceptance: Jodie Foster
Warmest reception: Lucille Ball and Bob Hope
Least promising rock singer: Rob Lowe
Worst reader of teleprompter: Walter Matthau</SUM>

Oscar, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment industry, has no 
copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences had sued Creative House Promotions (Chicago), manufacturer of an employee-
incentive award that the judge acknowledged was "very similar" to the Oscar. 

U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Water rejected the academy's legal claims, saying 
that the statuette was in the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the 
Copyright Act of 1976. 

The first Oscars and all those distributed until about 1941 did not bear a mark 
indicating copyright.</SUM>

Spike Lee, in a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday at Syracuse University, 
shrugged off the icy treatment of his latest movie by the Academy Award voters. Widely 
hailed by critics, the 1989 film "Do the Right Thing," received only two Academy Award 
nominations and was not recommended for best picture or best director. Lee commented 
that the academy's membership consists mainly of "old people" more comfortable with 
the black chauffeur in "Driving Miss Daisy" than with the angry characters in his film.

The students warmly welcomed Lee. As one student said, "He's an African 
American" and he's addressing the issues "affecting our community."</SUM>
