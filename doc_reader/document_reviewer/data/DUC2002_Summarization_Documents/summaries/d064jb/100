To capitalize on Asia's fastest-growing economy McDonald's opened its first outlet in 
South Korea.  Moving into communist countries, on March 24, 1988 it opened in 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  There to compete with the locally favored "pljeskavica", a pork 
and onion sandwich, initial reaction was favorable.  Two years later came its largest 
outlet to date.  In Moscow thousands lined up for an opening day record of 30,000 meals 
being served at 27 cash registers.  Next, McDonald's opened in China, where cooking is a 
culinary art.  McDonald's worldwide restaurants are joint ventures with locals of the 
country in which they operate.</SUM>
