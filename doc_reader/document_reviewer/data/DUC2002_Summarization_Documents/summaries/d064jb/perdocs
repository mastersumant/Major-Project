John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters said the first of 
the chain's outlets in a communist country will open on March 24th.  The success of the 
American restaurant will depend on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long 
accustomed to eating the hamburger like pljeskavica which is made of pork and onions, 
served on bread and eaten with the hands, much like a hamburger.  The next scheduled 
opening in a communist country will occur by the end of the year in Budapest, Hungary.  
McDonald's negotiations with the Soviet Union over many years have not been fruitful.</SUM>

Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a 
restaurant in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.  This, its first outlet in a communist country, has 350 
seats, employs 110 people and is capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.  Police kept an 
eye on eager customers who waited in line for hours to get in.  The McDonald's 
hamburgers, fries and shakes will compete with a local favorite fast-food dish, the 
pljeskavica, ground pork and onions on a bun.  In a change to Yugoslav eating customs, 
McDonalds will not serve alcohol or allow smoking, nor allow customers to linger long 
after their meal is finished.</SUM>

McDonald's will open its first outlets in Korea through a 50-50 joint venture, McAhn 
Industries Ltd., founded with Harvard trained accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Mr. Ahn 
Hyo Young.  McAhn struggled to overcome government red tape and to find reliable 
local produce suppliers.  Starting modestly, their strategy is to open three outlets this year 
and five each year thereafter.  South Korea has Asia's fastest growing economy.  
McAhn's hope is to develop McDonald's image as an affordable place for the Korean 
middle class rather than a familiar name for foreigners.  Attention will be given to 
attracting children.  Currently they face competition from Wendy's, Burger King and 
homegrown burger chains.</SUM>

Hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening of McDonald's on Moscow's 
Pushkin Square.  Musicians played and dancers danced.  The world's newest, largest 
McDonald's then proceeded to ring up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the 
opening day record for McDonald's worldwide.  Generally accustomed to clerks who 
snarl, Muscovites got a first-hand look at efficient, fast and friendly service.  For most 
customers it was their first experience with a hamburger.  Initial reactions were favorable.  
This is the first of twenty McDonald's planned for the Soviet Union.  It brought to 52 the 
number of countries where McDonald's operates.</SUM>

McDonald's first Soviet Union restaurant seats 700, has 27 cash registers and served 
30,000 people on its opening day.  Most customers were thrilled, but some gave it a 
mixed review.  Sam Yahel from McDonald's in Atlanta helped train its 630 employees.  
Cashiers learned that "please" and "thank you" and wiping the crumbs from counters are 
important.  Managers spent nine months abroad learning their jobs.  This restaurant 
means to cater to locals not foreigners.  But, prices are high compared to the state 
restaurants.  Dinner out for the family can come to two days wages for the average Soviet 
worker.</SUM>

McDonald's fries and hamburgers came to China Monday where cooking has long been 
considered a culinary art.  The 500-seat restaurant opened in Shenzhen, a special 
economic zone near Hong Kong.  In Shenzhen the average worker earns $53 a month, 
compared with $32 for many other Chinese.  It is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
McDonald's Hong Kong, which in turn, is a 50-50 joint venture with McDonald's in the 
United States.  Most of its ingredients are imported from Hong Kong but hopefully will 
eventually come from China.  The restaurant's 240 staffers were gleamed from 9,000 
applicants. Taste test: "I like it."</SUM>

As the value of the rouble plunges, Russian officials feel thankful to McDonald's, who 
opened their first restaurant in Moscow 3.5 years ago.  McDonald's of Canada opened a 
second restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-story office block.  It provides service 
jobs, gets most of its supplies from inside Russia, and operates using the rouble rather 
than dollars.  However, although the first Moscow McDonald's restaurant is the world's 
busiest, the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a 
challenge to McDonald's management.  They have no idea of when they will recoup their 
$50 million investment.</SUM>
