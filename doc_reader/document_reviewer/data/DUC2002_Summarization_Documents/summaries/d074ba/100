From Sept. 10 to Sept. 16, 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme 
Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas's refusal to answer certain questions 
caused complaints, but it appeared early on that the committee would approve the 
nomination. By the end of the questioning an affirmative vote of 10-4 or 9-5 was 
predicted. There was media attention to Thomas's wife Virginia. A successful 
Washington lawyer, she had taken strong conservative positions that antagonized 
certain groups and the fact that she was white and he black raised questions for some 
blacks. During the hearings lobbyists on either side worked to influence the ensuing 
vote of the full Senate.</SUM>
