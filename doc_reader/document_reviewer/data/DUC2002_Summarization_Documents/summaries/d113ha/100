In early March 1993 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reacted to a postponement of 
tax reform. By March 10 the BSE index sunk to a 13-month low at 2,287. On March 12 
a coordinated bomb attack against targets in Bombay including the BSE killed at least 
255 people and injured 1,200 threatening a resumption of Hindu-Moslem rioting which 
had occurred earlier. The BSE reopened on March 15, but on March 16 an explosion in 
Calcutta killed at least 45. Despite the tragedies and threat of war or rioting, the BSE 
index had climbed up as far as 2,409.23 by March 17.</SUM>
