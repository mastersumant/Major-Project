The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accuses the Bombay stock 
exchange of flouting regulations including those designed to limit excessive speculative 
investments. The exchange denies the allegations, but the dispute does nothing to 
stimulate the stock market where shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early 
last year. This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which date from 
SEBI's creation a year ago. Brokers claim the SEBI fails to understand their needs. The 
finance minister is backing SEBI to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent 
budget message.</SUM>

More than a dozen bombs exploded in Bombay last night killing about 200 people and 
injuring more than a thousand in India's commercial heart. The attack was a severe 
setback to India's attempts to recover from recent intercommunal violence sparked by 
razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6. 
Ensuing riots killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Moslems, including 700 in Bombay. 
Last night's targets included the Bombay Stock Exchange and the landmark Air India 
building. It was clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people whereas most of 
the victims of the riots were poor.</SUM>

13 explosions rocked Bombay on Friday leaving at least 255 people dead and over 
1,200 injured. Unlike the riots that racked the city last December, Friday's attack was 
clearly high-technology terrorism carried out with Semtex plastic explosives, high-grade 
timers, efficient organization and money. India's prime minister described the blasts as 
an attack on India's economy and said the search for the perpetrators "may not stop 
within the country," but stopped short of mentioning Pakistan. The Bombay Stock 
Exchange plans to resume trading today and  the people of Bombay have refused to be 
goaded into violent protest by the bombers.</SUM>

India suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion in the crowded trade 
and residential district of Bowbazaar in Calcutta destroyed two blocks of flats killing at 
least 45 people and injuring scores more. A militant Sikh group fighting for the 
independence of Punjab claims responsibility for the blast, but police and the interior 
minister suspect a foreign group or "an international conspiracy." The attack came just 
four days after a systematic bomb attack on India's commercial heart in Bombay, 
raising fears of a resumption of last December's intercommunal violence. Last night 
national and local leaders appealed for calm.</SUM>

Despite a bomb attack last Friday,  the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reopened 
Monday with the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent by Tuesday. Another bomb blast in 
Calcutta caused nervous selling yesterday and the index fell by 2.1 per cent to 
2,409.23. The Bombay equity market experienced unusually bullish speculation before 
the national budget was announced on February 27. Then the finance minister 
disappointed traders by postponing corporate tax reforms by a year and leaving the 
short-term capital gains tax for local investors at 44.5 per cent. Heavy selling drove 
down equity prices to a 13-month low with the BSE reaching 2287 on March 10.</SUM>
