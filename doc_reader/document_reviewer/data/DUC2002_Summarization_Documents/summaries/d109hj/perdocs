According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, water levels of 
the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers are dropping.

The Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang, in Guangdong Province, crested yesterday, the Bei Jiang at a 
record 10.39 meters. The industrialized Zhujiang Delta, however, is still threatened 
because it is traversed by a merged Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang.

reinforcement, therefore, must be accelerated.
