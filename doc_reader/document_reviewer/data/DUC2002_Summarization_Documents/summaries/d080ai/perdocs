Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case said today that they have reached a 
verdict on 52 counts of the case and remained deadlocked on the last 13 charges.  
Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are charged with 64 counts 
of molestation of children attending their family-owned pre-school and one count of 
conspiracy.  This is the longest, most costly, criminal trial in history.  Superior Court 
Judge William Pounds will hold a hearing on Thursday.  One decision could be opening 
the sealed verdicts.  Jurors, in the ninth week of deliberations, have questioned elements 
of the charges and appeared confused.</SUM>

The McMartin Pre-School molestation case began in August 1983 when Judy Johnson 
accused Raymond Buckey of molesting her son.  By March 1984, a public outcry had 
been created and seven people were arrested for abusing 18 children over 10 years.  In 
January 1986, the preliminary hearing, after 18 months and $4 million, brought 135 
counts against the seven.  Charges later were dismissed against all but Buckey and his 
mother.  Jury selection began in April 1987 and the actual trial ran from July until 
November 1989.  On January 18, 1990 they were acquitted on 52 counts, with a mistrial 
declared on 13 counts.</SUM>

Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case brought widely 
divergent reactions.  The defendants wept with relief.  Parents of former students decried 
the system for failing their children.  Special targets of criticism were the personal 
ambitions of the prosecutors and the decision to have a private child-therapy group 
interview potential victims.  Jurors said they were not convinced beyond a reasonable 
doubt and never got the children's stories in their own words.  The case was the longest 
and most costly in American judicial history.  The lurid story at times included 
allegations of hundreds of molestations by seven individuals, underground tunnels, and 
Satanic rituals.</SUM>

Seven jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case talked with reporters after 
their acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother on Thursday.  The jurors faulted the 
videotaped interviews with the children, saying the interviewers asked leading questions 
so the children could not tell their own story.  The jurors also criticized a letter sent to 
parents by police after the first accusation, saying the letter put information out too early 
and led parents.  The jurors said even if some of the children had been molested, it was 
not proven that it happened at the school.  The trial took an enormous toll on everyone.</SUM>

Neighbors of the McMartin Pre-School reacted today to the conclusion of the molestation 
trial against former teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 
who were acquitted of 52 charges on Thursday.  Residents of the upper-middle-class 
suburb agreed the case poisoned everyone associated with it.  Sue Brown was convinced 
they were guilty.  Alan Lagunoff, whose son testified, was disappointed in both sides.  He 
would like the deserted, rundown, school to become a center for abused children.  Brenda 
Platt would like it torn down and considered the case a disgrace.  Linda Geisert was 
disappointed in the legal system and the jurors.</SUM>

The story of the McMartin Pre-School molestation case appears headed for television and 
the bookstores.  Screenwriter and producer Abby Mann became interested in the theme--
the hysteria of a witch hunt--in 1986 and allied with both the prosecution and the defense.  
He and his wife have a manuscript and screenplay in the works.  Two other books are 
planned.  Others also see "movie of the week" potential.  The networks, however, may 
not be willing to run the lurid tale because of ambiguities created by the jury's deadlock 
on 13 of the charges.  Child abuse and molestation already have become a more visible 
Hollywood theme.</SUM>

A therapist defended her role in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial against 
Raymond Buckey and his mother, which ended Thursday with acquittal on 52 counts and 
13 counts deadlocked.  Jurors had criticized the techniques she used in videotaped 
interviews of McMartin students, claiming she asked leading questions.  The therapist, 
Kee McFarlane, says the techniques are sound and children must be helped to overcome 
their fears.  She also said she still believes the children had been molested and the 
outcome was tragic.  She suggested that therapy goals are not consistent with legal 
standards required for a successful prosecution.</SUM>

Who is to blame for the nation's longest and costliest trial, the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation case, which ended Thursday?  Raymond Buckey and his mother were 
acquitted on 52 counts and the jury deadlocked on the remaining 13.  Parents are blaming 
the system.  The original prosecutor, Robert Philibosian, denies he began the case to 
boost his run for district attorney and blames Ira Reiner, the current district attorney.  
Philibosian said Reiner hurt the case by dismissing charges against five defendants.  
Reiner claims he inherited a mess.  Many jurors believe some of the children were 
molested, but the state did not prove the defendants responsible.</SUM>

Although the longest criminal trial in history is over, a baffling array of civil suits may 
follow the McMartin Pre-School molestation case.  One defendant is suing her accusers 
and her son may follow suit.  Parents may file suits on behalf of their children, because 
the burden of proof is less in a civil litigation.  No decisions have yet been made and 
there are doubts that any money would be available if anyone should win.  Two related 
cases are underway.  In one, early defendants are suing those who broke the story and, in 
another, defendants and the pre-school are suing liability insurance carriers.</SUM>

A Hermosa Beach minister, originally implicated in the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation scandal, is seeking disability retirement.  Rev. John D. Eales heads St. Cross 
Episcopal Church where children allegedly were forced to watch animal sacrifices and 
Satanic rituals in 1985.  These allegations were never confirmed, but membership fell and 
the minister and church continued to face threatening phone calls and vandal attacks.  
More recently, a youth counselor at the church was charged with molesting two teenaged 
boys.  The stress has become too great for Eales, 61.  The McMartin trial, the longest 
criminal case in history, ended Thursday with no convictions.</SUM>

The longest, costliest, criminal trial in history ended Thursday when Ray Buckey and his 
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty on 52 counts in the McMartin 
Pre-School child molestation case.  The jury deadlocked on 13 counts.  Buckey did not 
comment, while his mother displayed anger.  The judge said he was not surprised.  
Parents and jurors criticized the prosecution, which blamed the system.  The sordid case 
began in 1983 and created a media frenzy and hysterical parents.  The 18-month 
preliminary hearing brought 135 charges against seven people.  Many charges were 
dropped, but the trial lasted more than 2 years.</SUM>
