Today in a moving ceremony  Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post, was 
hoisted by crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. Checkpoint Charlie, 
constructed after the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was a symbol of the Cold War. 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze praised the end of a legacy of confrontation which had required the 
checkpoint.  Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who as mayor of West 
Berlin had challenged erection of the wall in the early 1960's, was also in attendance. 
Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows to cheer.</SUM>

Today at an elaborate ceremony that brought together top diplomats of the two 
Germanys and the four World War II allies, a crane removed Checkpoint Charlie, 
symbol of a divided world. The German and allied foreign ministers are meeting in East 
Berlin to discuss the status of the city and U.S. officials decided this was a good time to 
remove Checkpoint Charlie.  All borders are to be opened between the Berlins and 
Germanys by July 2. Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily. 
Berliners witnessed the ceremony from nearby buildings recounting memories of  
attempts to escape from East Berlin through the checkpoint.</SUM>

On Friday a crane lifted Checkpoint Charlie, the Allied border crossing on the west side 
of the Berlin Wall, and placed it on a flatbed truck. The guardhouse was taken away in 
an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers,  a brass band and hundreds 
of reporters. The public was not invited to the ceremony but many Berliners viewed it 
from nearby, reliving memories of attempted escapes through the checkpoint that went 
up with the Berlin Wall in 1961. Now with the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation 
of German unification, U.S. officials decided to remove Checkpoint Charlie with a grand 
flourish.</SUM>

Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze proposed today that a united Germany be 
allowed to join NATO after a five-year period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops 
would leave the country.  U.S. Secretary of State Baker responded, "I am 
underwhelmed." The United States objects to the 5-year waiting period while the Soviet 
Union has opposed a united Germany's membership in NATO. Shevardnadze also 
remarked at a ceremony for the removal of Checkpoint Charlie that all western troops 
should be removed from "greater Berlin" within six months after unification, a provision 
which apparently would also apply to Soviet troops just outside the city proper.</SUM>

Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing by the Berlin Wall, will be hauled away 
Friday. A huge crane hangs over the guardhouse where a sign in English, German, 
Russian, and French says, "You are now leaving the American sector." U.S. Secretary 
of State Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from 
France, Britain, and the two Germanys will preside over a ceremonial removal of the 
checkpoint Friday. The statesmen were in East Berlin to discuss German unification. 
The U.S. decided two weeks ago, with huge sections of the wall being ripped down 
daily, that it was a good time to remove the landmark.</SUM>
