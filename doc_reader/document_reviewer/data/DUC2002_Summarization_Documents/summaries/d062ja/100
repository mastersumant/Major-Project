The California earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989 caused extensive damage. Despite heavy 
insurance losses, insurance company stocks posted gains as investors bet on 
increases in insurance rates producing a long-term increase in profits. In Washington, 
the White House appeared hyperactive, anxious to show its responsiveness to the 
disaster. In Sacramento, Governor Deukmejian called a special session of the 
legislature to deal with the crisis. Critics accused him of blaming others for the collapse 
of freeways and called on him to get on with reconstruction and a temporary increase of 
the gasoline tax so hundreds of thousands of commuters could get to work.</SUM>
