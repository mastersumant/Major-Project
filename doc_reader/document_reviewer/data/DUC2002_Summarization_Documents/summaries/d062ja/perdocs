In the wake of Tuesday's earthquake many San Francisco-area homeowners will pay 
for damage out-of-pocket while insurance companies may actually benefit from the 
quake. Only 25-30 percent of area homeowners carry earthquake insurance. Of the 
estimated $500 million in residential damage, between $100 million and $150 million is 
insured.  The insurance companies, after three years of declining rates, are likely to win 
rate hikes from state regulators to compensate for the combined losses from the 
earthquake and Hurricane Hugo which hit the southeastern United States earlier this 
month. Thus, disappointing earnings in the fourth quarter may be followed by greater 
profitability in the long run.</SUM>

Yesterday, in response to the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew 
into a whirlwind of activity that seemed designed to dispel any thought that the White 
House was not engaged. After the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the devastation of 
Hurricane Hugo the administration was criticized for its slow response. Bush as much 
as admitted that the present flurry of activism was intended to counter such criticism, 
remarking during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that he hoped 
there would be "less carping" this time about the Agency's performance. The President 
may visit the earthquake site this weekend.</SUM>

Although insurers will pay out billions of dollars for damage from this week's California 
earthquake, investors predict that the psychological impact of the catastrophe will 
produce higher insurance rates and a long-term gain for insurance companies. Losses 
by insurers this year will probably include $2 billion to $4 billion from the quake added to 
$4 billion from Hurricane Hugo. But it is likely that as insurers increase the amount of 
reinsurance they buy, reinsurance prices will rise followed by an increase in basic 
insurance rates. Confidence in this scenario of market forces has produced strong 
gains in insurance company stocks.</SUM>

The nature of this week's California earthquake is described by some of those on the 
scene. One reported from the World Series at Candlestick Park that the upper deck 
was shaking and the light stanchions were swaying.  A driver approaching San 
Francisco thought she had hit fog. "Then I could see a big ball of flame." Another found 
assessing the damage from the quake is "like the blind man trying to feel an elephant."  
A school teacher commented, "It was like somebody slugging a punching bag...this 
one went on and on...it just wouldn't stop...it was very very bad."</SUM>

Governor Deukmejian has rightly called the Legislature into special session to take 
necessary action after last Tuesday's earthquake. But the Governor should cease  
distancing himself from the issue of what caused the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland. Vulnerable because of his past opposition to a gasoline tax increase that 
would augment transportation funding, the Governor seems more interested in diverting 
blame than in learning everything possible from Tuesday's disaster. The challenge is to 
rebuild  so that hundreds of thousands of commuters can get back to work. The special 
legislative session should consider a temporary gasoline tax increase to fund highway 
reconstruction.</SUM>
