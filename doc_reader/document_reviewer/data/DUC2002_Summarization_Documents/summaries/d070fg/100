In October 1989, after being hospitalized for kidney surgery, former East German leader Erich 
Honecker--along with other Party officials--was arrested and imprisoned to await trial for 
treason and corruption. Judged too ill from imprisonment, he was placed in a Soviet East Berlin 
hospital. He also faced a murder charge about his role in killing people trying to escape from 
East Berlin.

In 1992, Honecker took refuge in the Chilean Embassy in Moscow but was soon ordered to 
leave. In Germany, he was tried, imprisoned and released in 1993. He died in Santiago, Chile in 
1994 at age 81.</SUM>
