Former East German leader Erich Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from 
enraged citizens. Since being ousted in October, Honecker and other party officials have been 
investigated for corruption and living in luxury at cost to the state.

Honecker is under house arrest in government housing outside East Berlin, which is being 
converted to a medical rehabilitation center.  Lutheran and Catholic churches have offered 
protection and refuge fearing he would be attacked and lynched if placed in smaller quarters as 
demanded by East German groups calling for his punishment.

Currently, Honecker is seriously ill following gall-bladder surgery.</SUM>

Egon Krenz, the successor to East Germany's leader Erich Honecker, and former Politburo 
member Guenter Schabowski gave their version of the mentality of the hard-liners toward the 
end. Krenz told an investigating commission that the former Party leadership had the notion that 
everything outside of planned events and demonstrations by the Communist Youth Group was 
organized by "enemy forces."

Krenz and Schabowski denied personal responsibility for orders to attack demonstrators, noting 
that Honecker and Secret-Police Chief Erich Mielke, bypassing the Politburo, engineered 
attempts at suppression. However, Krenz accepted joint responsibility for misjudging dissident 
citizens and groups for years.</SUM>

Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison after his release 
from a hospital where he underwent surgery for a kidney tumor. He is to be tried for high treason 
in March, along with former Politburo members Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittag, and Joachim 
Hermann. Eleven other ousted members are in prison awaiting trial. East Germany has been in a 
frenzy to root out corruption.

Honecker could be sentenced to a maximum of life imprisonment. His doctors say that he is too 
ill to stay in jail. East Germany's Lutheran Church has offered to place him in a home for the

Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was 
arrested Monday following his release from a hospital where he had undergone kidney tumor

misuse of their positions and State funds.

Honecker has been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment. It is not known if the prison

East Germany's deposed Communist leader, Erich Honecker, has been declared too sick to be in 
jail but fit enough to be tried. He is still recovering from kidney cancer surgery in January. A 
medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials--all close aides to 
Honecker--were fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody despite advanced age and poor 
health. Along with Honecker, they are charged with corruption and abuse of office.

Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside East Berlin. Although their poor 
health often disrupted proceedings, investigations against the former East German leaders will 
continue.</SUM>

East German authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about 
his role in the killing of some 200 people trying to escape from East Germany's Communist rule. 
Honecker, would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths. 
Along with several other members of his ousted regime, he already has been charged with 
corruption and abuse of power.

The murder charge could put Honecker away for life. His poor health and his age, 77, make 
prosecution questionable. He has been judged too ill for imprisonment but fit enough for 
prosecution. He is staying in a hospital outside East Berlin.</SUM>

A West German newspaper reported that ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not 
stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists, although he could 
be prosecuted in a united Germany for violation of property laws.

Honecker allegedly used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for Communist 
government leaders. However, the investigation is not far enough along to determine whether 
charges would be filed against Honecker before the East German-West German merger. He is 
under investigation for abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists, and issuing shoot-to-kill 
orders against East Germans escaping to West Germany.</SUM>

East Germany's ousted Secret Police Chief Erich Mielke, when he faced former Communist 
leader Erich Honecker, called him a traitor and threatened to break his neck. Honecker was jailed 
in January but was released after one day for health reasons. 

Mielke, one of Honecker's closest aides, headed the dreaded secret police know as Stasi. One 
prison warden said that many of the guards had worked for Mielke's Stasi and might interpret his 
threat as an order to kill Honecker, who will be moved to the same jail if his health improves. He 
is in a hospital and suffering from kidney cancer.</SUM>

A newspaper has reported one of the first issues facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed 
several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together. Germany has demanded the 
Soviets hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter 
charges. A federal lawmaker said refusal to turn him over for trial could "burden" Bonn and 
Moscow's "outstanding relations."

A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker accusing him of issuing shoot-to-kill 
orders to East German guards. Honecker is in a Soviet hospital near Berlin. Soviet officials say 
German police need Soviet permission to enter.</SUM>

Mikhail Gorbachev urged all sides to take their time deciding the fate of Erich Honecker as the 
fugitive former East German leader spent a seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean Embassy in 
Moscow. Germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted to flee to 
the West during his regime. There is speculation, however, that German politicians have little 
real interest in trying a man who may possess embarrassing secrets.

Gorbachev, Honecker's protector until the Soviet leader's political fortunes declined, has ordered 
Honecker to leave the country. North Korea apparently has offered to accept Honecker.</SUM>

Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday 
morning May 29, 1994. His lawyer, who represented the 81-year old Honecker before the Berlin 
court in 1992 and early 1993, said Honecker rejected an operation but could not comment on the 
exact cause of Honecker's death. A colleague said earlier that he had obviously died from his 
liver cancer.

After release from prison in 1993, Honecker traveled to Santiago to join his daughter who is 
married to a Chilean. He and his wife had been living in a wealthy Santiago area.</SUM>
