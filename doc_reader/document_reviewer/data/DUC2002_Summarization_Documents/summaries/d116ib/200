Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its 
history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Named after the 
American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the "Big Bang" 
concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.  While orbiting at 380 
statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide 
astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity 
than ground-based observatories.  Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to 
look back almost to the beginning of time. 
 
The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later 
than planned.  A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, 
causing the delay.  Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the 
panel manually if necessary.  Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were 
unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay 
satellite.  A weaker back-up antenna system is working.  The telescope was placed on 
special flight modes until these start-up problems are resolved.  Confident that the Hubble 
will soon be operational, the shuttle Discovery is preparing to return home.</SUM>
