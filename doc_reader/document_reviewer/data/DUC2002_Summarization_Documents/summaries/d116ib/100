The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 
billion Hubble Space Telescope.  While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will 
provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more 
sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  The telescope's release from the shuttle 
Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully 
unfurled.  Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two 
high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.  However, scientists, optimistic that 
the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return 
home.</SUM>
