On Tuesday, a second attempt will be made to launch the shuttle Discovery with the $1.5 
billion Hubble Space Telescope aboard.  A faulty power unit forced cancellation of the 
first attempt on April 10.  Meanwhile, shuttle Columbia is also being prepped to launch a 
satellite called Astro.  This is only the second time both shuttle pads at Kennedy Space 
Center have been occupied simultaneously.  Discovery will aim to place the telescope in 
orbit at an altitude of 380 miles where astronomers hope it will be able to look back 
almost to the beginning of time.  Columbia's Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation.</SUM>

Countdown resumed Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch on Tuesday to 
boost the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.  The new Tuesday launch day is 
14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty 
hydraulic power steering unit.  The replacement power unit was successfully test fired 
and the telescope's battery charging was completed one day ahead of schedule.  A NASA 
spokesman said they were 80% go for launch weather-wise.  With Discovery on track, 
engineers readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad for its May 16 
Spacelab astronomy mission.</SUM>

With the Hubble Space Telescope about to be launched, astronomers are again excited 
about what it might accomplish.  It will scan the outermost reaches of space for clues 
about the origin and possible end of the universe.  Its launch has been delayed since 1983 
by technical problems and the Challenger accident.  At an altitude of 380 miles, it will 
orbit far above earth's distorting atmosphere.  During its 15-year working lifetime, the 
telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more 
sensitivity than ground-based observatories. Its use, shared with the European Space 
Agency, will cost about $200 million per year.</SUM>

Shortly after launch aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the Hubble Space 
Telescope sent its first test radio signal.  Cheers erupted in Huston's Mission Control.  
Some scientists have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since 
Galileo first raised a small telescope to his eye nearly 400 years ago.  The Hubble is 
expected to help answer two major questions: How old is the universe?  How big is the 
Universe?  The telescope is comprised of two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers 
and a photometer.  Now running on batteries, astronauts are standing by to act should its 
solar power panels fail to unfurl.</SUM>

The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope left the shuttle Discovery's cargo bay on 
Wednesday, nearly two hours and one orbit late, for orbit 380 statute miles above the 
earth's distorting atmosphere.  It took three attempts to deploy the telescope's second 
solar array panel, thus causing the delayed release from Discovery to operational orbit.  
Suited astronauts were standing by to manually unfurl the solar panels if necessary.  
Next, after first testing the telescope's maneuverability, the 10-foot aperture door will be 
opened on Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.  NASA 
expects its first images from space on Tuesday.</SUM>

The space shuttle Discovery soared to a record high orbit of 380 miles to deploy the $1.5 
billion Hubble Space Telescope.  Sadly, many of the scientists who worked so hard for 
this moment missed the launch from earth because it was aborted the first time due to 
problems.  Possibly the finest optical instrument ever created, when activated, it should 
produce images 10 times sharper than the largest earthbound telescopes.  Once free from 
the shuttle, the Hubble has six hours in which to deploy its solar power arrays, otherwise 
sensitive internal equipment could be damaged.  Twelve years after conception, it will 
soon be operational.</SUM>

The shuttle Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5 billion Hubble Space 
Telescope.  It happened one orbit late, after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck 
solar panel, averting an emergency spacewalk by crewmembers standing by to pull out 
the array if necessary.  The telescope's batteries were only good for eight hours.  With the 
troublesome panel unfurled, astronaut Steve Crawley used the shuttle's mechanical arm 
to lift the 12.5 ton Hubble from the cargo bay.  Discovery then backed away as the 
telescope, orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles, began its 15-year 
search for new worlds.</SUM>

Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact with the 
Hubble's two main antennas after trying for more than six hours to lock on.  The 
telescope's two low-gain antennas, which can be used in an emergency, were working 
well.  A Goddard spokesman said a pointing problem and the inexperience in dealing 
with a new spacecraft was the cause.  The shuttle Discovery will follow 46 miles behind 
the Hubble, NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft, until controllers are sure it is 
operating properly.  An earlier problem with unfurling a solar power panel was resolved.  
The next milestone is opening the aperture door.</SUM>

The Hubble Space Telescope's science instruments are on hold, unable to begin 
observations.  The Hubble had been on "safe mode" with all motion stopped because of 
earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.  Ground 
controllers then took the telescope out of safe mode and began to run a 12-hour computer 
program to monitor its health.  It is now on a "normal control-all mode" where its own 
computers and sensors guide it.  Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for 
initial operations and that caused many malfunctions.  With most resolved, the shuttle 
Discovery astronauts are preparing to return home.</SUM>

The eyepiece used by astronomer Edwin Hubble from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 
100-inch Hooker Telescope, once the world's most powerful, was carried into orbit by 
the shuttle that launched the space telescope honoring him, a symbolic gesture from 
astronomy's past to its future.  Using the Hooker telescope, Hubble was the first to 
determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way.  This provided evidence for 
the concept that the universe is expanding.  His work helped convince scientists that the 
universe was created in a giant explosion, called the "big bang."  The Hooker Telescope 
was mothballed in 1985.</SUM>
