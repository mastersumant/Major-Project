Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc have magnified the emerging 
opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration 
of thousands of disaffected East Germans has impelled  West Germany's Parliamentary 
Speaker to place the subject of reunification on his committee's agenda.  Recent polls 
show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunified Germany, but 
officials there are circumspect of the concerns of Washington and Moscow.  However, 
the U.S. Ambassador to Bonn predicted that reunion could occur relatively soon.  
Because East Germany is the Soviet's most important Warsaw Pact satellite, Moscow 
may not be so agreeable.</SUM>

With growing numbers of disgruntled East Germans emigrating to West Germany, the 
idea of reunification seems possible and is being seriously discussed.  Most West German 
officials and President Bush support the idea.  Soviet and East German leaders oppose it, 
Honecker much more strongly than Gorbachev.  Throughout the rest of Europe unification 
scenarios are being considered and discussed by officials and media commentators.  
Recalling Nazi Germany's sordid past, some express a mistrust toward uniting a 
Germany that could become Europe's economic powerhouse with almost 80 million 
people.  Still others believe we ought not be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date 
assumptions.</SUM>

As recent actions by East Germany make German reunification more likely, many policy 
wonks point out serious problems to be overcome.  A new structure or relationship 
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact may be needed.  Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to 
JFK, states that the U.S. couldn't afford a united Germany outside the Western Alliance 
and the Soviets can't afford one inside the Western Alliance.  He hopes unification can be 
forged within a reunited Europe.  William Hyland, a former aide to Henry Kissinger, and 
former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, expressed similar concerns 
about conflicting European, U.S. and Soviet interests.</SUM>

As President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev prepare for a shipboard summit off 
Malta on Saturday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting U.S. senators that West 
Germany would not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany.  There has been 
speculation that West Germany might be tempted to agree to neutrality if the Kremlin 
stipulates it as price for reunification.  U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters joined 
Senator Richard Lugar, head of an American delegation of eight senators, for a 75-minute 
closed-door talk with Kohl.  Afterward, Senator Lugar said the West German's were 
committed to remain in NATO: "Without any reservations."</SUM>

Poland's Solidarity Government's first definitive statement on the issue of a reunified 
German state said such a state "must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders".  
Some right-wing West German politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square 
miles of territory that Germany lost to Poland at the end of World War II.  The territory is 
about one-third of present-day Poland.  East and West Germany have each separately 
recognized the present border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified 
Germany would.  Poland's Foreign Minister Skubiszewski reassured Poles that its 
government will insist on current borders.</SUM>

Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist domination two months 
ago, public pressure has forced the opening of the Berlin Wall and garnered the promise 
of free elections.  However, the issue of reunification could fracture the popular East 
German movement.  Although the Communists admit that East Germany's socialist 
system has failed, many East German's are seeking a new "democratic socialism" within 
a multi-party system.  They favor a type of partnership with West Germany rather than 
reunification.  Pro and anti reunification rallies came shortly after the four victorious 
World War II Allies met to discuss the latest East German developments.</SUM>

Soviet President Gorbachev after meeting with East German Premier Modrow on 
Tuesday appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification.  Gorbachev's 
position appears similar to that adopted by the East German Communists when they 
acknowledged unity as a long-term goal, but under no specific timetable.  Gorbachev said 
unification decisions must include the four Allied powers and take into account European 
opinions.  It now appears that unification is inevitable.  Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of 
West Germany's Free Democratic Party, acknowledging Gorbachev's "more positive 
attitude" urged "economic union" within 18 months as a prelude to full union of East and 
West Germany.</SUM>

Soviet President Gorbachev said he believed one Germany was likely in the future, but 
that Germans "should not decide this important question in the streets", referring to the 
growing number of demonstrations in East Germany.  Many German Communists 
believe the reunification drive is moving too quickly.  This issue will surely dominate the 
election that will soon seat new East German leadership.  Disgraced former Communist 
Leader, Erich Honecker, was ousted on October 18, expelled from the Party and then 
jailed for treason and abuse of power.  He was released Tuesday after justice officials 
determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment.</SUM>

About 20,000 East Germans demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification.  
Despite reforms, nearly 2000 skilled East German workers continue to leave their 
homeland daily.  West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that East Germany is 
rapidly approaching insolvency.  The economy is in a sorrowful state.  The political 
authority is crumbling.  Protesters in the East German town of Prenzlau demonstrated 
against the Soviet stationing of helicopters in their town, replacing a tank unit that had 
been stationed at a military base there.  The town council is calling for civilian use of the 
base.  West German officials expect a reunification plan to be ready before year-end.</SUM>

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from meeting with 
President Gorbachev in Moscow that "the way is now free" for German unification.  
Kolh said that the East German March election has to come first, and then everything will 
go quickly.  West Germany's Social Democratic Party has a surprisingly strong, fledging 
branch in East Germany.  If the two Germanys unite before the West German election in 
December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what is today East 
Germany--presuming they could vote in December--could easily tip the balance away 
from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of government leadership.</SUM>

West Germany's Chancellor Kolh and East Germany's Prime Minister Modrow to 
discuss "the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of

American historians agree that fears of a resurgent militaristic German State after 
reunification are baseless.  Most believe that a politically and economically collapsing 
East Germany represents a greater threat to world stability.  However, there is not 
agreement on how a unified Germany will affect its European neighbors and Soviet bloc 
countries.  A dominant German economy could slow or even reverse what has been 
emerging European economic integration.  Furthermore, while most West Europeans 
have gotten over nationalistic mistrusts, East Europeans living in closed societies have 
not.  One historian urges caution.  Reunification could prove explosive if mishandled.  
West Germans are aware of their neighbors' misgivings.</SUM>

Edgar Bronfman, President of the World Jewish Congress, announced a scheduled 
conference in the Berlin villa where Nazi leadership met to implement the "final 
solution" against Europe's Jews.  The purpose is to formulate a formal declaration

be made on May 8 is to see that the Holocaust cannot happen again. Bronfman said he 
doesn't fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism from a united Germany; in fact, reunification 
may cause a decline in anti-Jewish feeling.  They won't be blaming Jews for a divided

The Bundesbank, Germany's independent central bank, is resisting political pressure 
from the German government and the governments and central banks of Europe to cut 
interest rates in order to ease large German deficits and inflationary pressures.  The 
European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of the 
Bundesbank's policies.  Very high real interest rates threaten to turn a European recession 
into a depression.  European governments believe the Bundesbank's intransigence is 
threatening nearly 10 years of effort for greater European economic and political 
integration and urge it to become more responsive to broader European interests.</SUM>
