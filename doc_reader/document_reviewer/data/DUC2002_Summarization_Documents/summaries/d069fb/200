Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc magnified the emerging opposition to 
uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.  The mass emigration of tens of 
thousands of skilled East German workers to West Germany led West German officials 
to conclude that reunification, which was codified in the West German constitution, was 
possible.  Polls in West Germany supported the idea, as did the U.S. President, George 
Bush.  Soviet President Gorbachev and East German leader, Erich Honecker, did not.  
Eventually, Honecker was arrested for treason and abuse of power and Gorbachev 
softened his position.  He and interim East German Premier Hans Modrow realized that 
the East German socialist system had failed and reunion would occur.  However, they 
envisioned a gradual, no-timetable approach toward confederation while European-wide 
issues were being worked out.  Of paramount importance to Gorbachev was the effect 
reunification would have on NATO and Warsaw Pact relationships.  Poland was 
concerned that a united German might want to recover 40,000 square miles of land that 
was part of Germany before World War II.  And Jews worldwide feared that a militarily 
resurgent Germany could inflict another Holocaust.  After Gorbachev abolished the 
Warsaw Pact things moved quickly.  All European and Jewish issues were addressed.  
Reunification occurred.</SUM>
