Former Texas Senator John Tower and his daughter were killed in the crash of a commuter plane 
on Sea Island, off the coast of Georgia. Senator Tower had been President Bush's nominee for 
Secretary of defense, but the nomination was rejected by the Senate on the recommendation of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee. This was only the ninth time in history that a cabinet 
nominee has been rejected. The committee recommended rejection after hearing allegations about 
Tower's use of alcohol and his inappropriate behavior towards women. The committee also 
questioned his dealings with defense contractors after Tower gave contradictory testimony.</SUM>
