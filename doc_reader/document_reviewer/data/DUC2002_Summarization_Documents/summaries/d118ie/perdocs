The Senate Armed Services Committee, controlled by the Democrats, has voted 11-9 along party 
lines to recommend that the full senate reject the nomination of former senator John Tower as 
Secretary of Defense. this comes after allegations that on the 1970s, Tower would consume as 
much as a bottle of scotch in one sitting. Rep. Larry Combest, who originally made the allegation, 
later said that Tower and a group of friends, not Tower alone, had frequently consumed a bottle 
Scotch. Tower, in admitting that he had a drinking problem in the 1970s, promised no to touch a 
drop of alcohol if nominated.</SUM>

The first controversy surrounding a Bush cabinet nominee has erupted during the confirmation 
hearings of former Senator John Tower as Secretary of Defense. In testimony before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, Paul Weyrich told the committee that Tower may lack the moral 
fiber for the position, citing inappropriate use of alcohol and questionable associations with 
women. Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses has caused some committee members to 
rethink their position on the nomination. Committee chairman Sam Nunn, of the other hand 
commented that there has been a surplus of rumor and a shortage of personal knowledge.</SUM>

The nomination of John Tower as Secretary of Defense failed in the Senate as Tower fell victim 
to charges of moral and ethical misbehavior. Tower insisted that Senator Nunn used FBI inquiries 
to discredit him and to strike at the president of the United States. Tower was qualified for the 
job, having himself served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Tower's 
intelligence and patriotism were never in question and it came as a surprise to him that he had 
made many enemies in Washington. Allegations from conservative groups as well as Tower's 
second wife fed the rumors surrounding him.</SUM>

The Senate voted 53 to 47 to reject the nomination of former Texas Senator John tower as 
Secretary of Defense. The vote came after a bitter and divisive debate which centered on Tower's 
drinking habits, his inappropriate behavior toward women and business dealings with defense 
contractors. This is only the ninth time that a president's cabinet choice has been rejected and the 
first time it has occurred so early in a new administration. The defeat was credited to the decision 
by Senator Sam Nun, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to oppose him. Nunn's 
decision caused the other Democrats on the committee to fall in line behind him.</SUM>

The Senate panel considering John Tower's nomination as Secretary of Defense has found 
discrepancies in his dealings with defense contractors. The panel members cited differences in his 
testimony before the group and what he wrote in a deposition given at the time of his divorce 
from his second wife in 1987. Tower had told the panel that he only represented British 
Aerospace, Inc. on matters of civil aviation. In the deposition, however, he wrote that he had 
given the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense department. The panel also is 
concerned about Tower's drinking habits and reports of womanizing.</SUM>

as well as investigating police records on several car accidents. In one of these accidents, Tower 
slightly injured the son of Senator Joe Montoya. Tower is also accused of giving contradictory 
testimony to the committee on his dealings with defense contractors.</SUM>

Despite predictions of dire results following the defeat of the nomination of John Tower for 
Secretary of Defense, Washington is quiet. President Bush, although he defended his nominee to 
the bitter end has said that it is time to move on. The blockage of the nomination came following 
allegations of problems with alcohol and inappropriate dealings with defense contractors. In an 
unprecedented and humiliating step, Tower announced on TV that he would stop drinking.  Later, 
he even went so far as to offer to take the position on a six month probationary basis. Neither 
offer was considered by Senate.</SUM>
