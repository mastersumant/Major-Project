<s docid="SJMN91-06097121" num="7" wdcount="28"> Former Sen. John Tower of 
Texas and his daughter were among 23 people killed Friday when the 
twin-engine commuter plane they were aboard crashed while trying to 
land.</s>

<s docid="AP890309-0143" num="11" wdcount="29"> The Democratic-controlled 
Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as 
defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 
days into his term.</s>

<s docid="AP890309-0143" num="13" wdcount="33"> It was only the ninth time in 
200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet 
choice and the only time it has done so early in a new 
administration.</s>

<s docid="LA021189-0003" num="20" wdcount="52"> Lawmakers from both parties 
have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing 
appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his 
employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 
1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace 
paid him .</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="36" wdcount="23"> Tower not only shunned 
withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if only 
the Senate would let him have the job.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="39" wdcount="30"> Republicans proposed that he 
get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a 
gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the 
presidency.</s>
