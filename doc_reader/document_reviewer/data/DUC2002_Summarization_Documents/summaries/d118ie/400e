<s docid="AP890309-0143" num="11" wdcount="29"> The Democratic-controlled

<s docid="AP890309-0143" num="13" wdcount="33"> It was only the ninth time in 
200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet 
choice and the only time it has done so early in a new 
administration.</s>

<s docid="AP890211-0110" num="12" wdcount="44"> The Senate Armed Services 
Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and 
onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look

to defense contractors.</s>

<s docid="LA021189-0003" num="58" wdcount="37"> D. Dignan, who performed 
surgery to remove a polyp from Tower's colon on Jan. 5, said that after 
the operation he advised Tower to limit his drinking to one or two 
glasses of wine with dinner .</s>

<s docid="LA020189-0050" num="20" wdcount="33"> He has been dogged by reports 
that he is a hard-drinker and a womanizer and that his hawkish views on 
defense do not square with the budgetary austerity that the Pentagon 
faces .</s>

<s docid="LA020489-0035" num="42" wdcount="34"> Army Times, another prominent 
defense community publication, says Tower is unsuited for the Defense

about his nomination.</s>

<s docid="LA021189-0003" num="20" wdcount="52"> Lawmakers from both parties 
have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing 
appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his 
employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 
1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace 
paid him .</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="36" wdcount="23"> Tower not only shunned

the Senate would let him have the job.</s>

<s docid="AP890316-0012" num="37" wdcount="11"> Tower promised to quit 
drinking, taking the pledge on national television.</s>

get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a 
gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the 
presidency.</s>
