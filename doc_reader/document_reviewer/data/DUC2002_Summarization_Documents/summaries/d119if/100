Some of President Bush's nominees for ambassadorships have been selected as
a reward for large money contributions to the Republican Party, according to
Democratic senators, and some retired diplomats consider a few not to be
qualified.   These nominees faced strong questioning from the Democrats
during committee hearings but did manage to get a slim approval from the
committee.  Conservative senators objected to two of Bush's selections.
Most of the president's picks won easy approval.  Two of Bush's picks
received highly favorable reaction: a Latin American expert for ambassador
to Nicaragua, and the naming of Thomas Pickering, a well-known diplomat, to
India.</SUM>
