<s docid="SJMN91-06234109" num="5" wdcount="27"> Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev was said to be back in power today and returning to Moscow as the
coup against him collapsed and its leaders reportedly fled.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06234209" num="23" wdcount="41"> The coup's failure could deal a
fatal blow to organized, high-level efforts to thwart reform drives in the
Soviet Union by Gorbachev and Yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of
power that has characterized Soviet power for the six-year Gorbachev
era.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06235097" num="21" wdcount="31"> At his news conference,
Gorbachev made a point of publicly praising Yeltsin, whose folk-hero stature
was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of thousands of his
supporters to resist.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="15" wdcount="32"> But the people of the Soviet
Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself,
but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms
had created.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06235187" num="40" wdcount="40"> As Gorbachev had previously
discovered in his negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the
legitimacy provided by the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the
elections for president of the Russian federation was a formidable political
force.</s>


<s docid="SJMN91-06236235" num="16" wdcount="49"> Some of the demonstrators
chanted, "Down with the Communist Party!"; Yeltsin, who had led the
nationwide resistance to the coup, announced a ban on Communist Party
activities in the Russian republic, the army, police units of the Interior
Ministry and the KGB, which for decades helped enforce Communist rule.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06236241" num="18" wdcount="48"> Yeltsin has been a strong foe of
Communist Party influence in the country; Gorbachev, however, warned in his
speech against "any kind of anti-Communist hysteria."; Yeltsin commented
frequently during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him several
times on details of what happened while Gorbachev was in detention.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="6" wdcount="37"> With the old order of Bolshevik
power and ideology in ruins, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev demanded the
resignation Friday of his entire government and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin shut down Communist Party organizations throughout the vast
republic.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="11" wdcount="35"> Yeltsin, the triumphant leader
of the resistance against this week's military coup, has drastically tipped
the balance of power here, showing himself to be at least the political
equal, if not the master, of Gorbachev.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="12" wdcount="39"> In a symbol of the new order,
the Russian tricolor, the banner of the anti-coup resistance, flew over the
gates of the Kremlin alongside the red Soviet flag for the first time since
the rise of the Bolshevik state.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06237020" num="44" wdcount="49"> Although this seemingly endless
political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common
language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new
Union Treaty, it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the
great floating opera of Soviet politics.</s>
