Soviet hard-liners attempted a coup in order to thwart the impending signing
of the new Union Treaty incorporating the reforms of Soviet President
Gorbachev.  The coup leaders put Gorbachev under house arrest in the Crimea.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin led opposition to the coup, which did not
have popular support, and it was put down after three days.  Gorbachev was
returned to Moscow and was reinstated as president.  Some observers wondered
about Gorbachev's actions just before the coup attempt since he had ignored
ample warnings that it might happen. Conspiracy buffs even wondered if
Gorbachev might have even been part of the planning.

Upon his return to power, Gorbachev ordered the arrest of the coup leaders
and made new appointments to key positions.  The putdown of the coup meant
that the reforms giving more authority to the republics would go forward.
Gorbachev and Yeltsin approached the reforms differently.  Gorbachev wanted
to work through the Communist Party, but Yeltsin had quit the party and
wanted to see its influence lessened.  Yeltsin was clearly more in touch
with the people.  The two leaders made a joint appearance at the Russian
Parliament where it became increasingly clear that Gorbachev's authority was
waning while Yeltsin's was ascending.</SUM>
