A huge explosion yesterday in the lounge of the Royal Marines School of Music killed 
ten and injured 22, eight seriously. The School is located in Deal on the English Channel. 
Eyewitness accounts of neighbors attest to the strength of the blast.

Investigators said that it was probably a bomb blast, and the IRA has claimed 
responsibility. The British think that at least two IRA "active service" units, each with 
four or five members, operate in Britain and continental Europe. Increased IRA activity 
had been anticipated because last month marked the 20th anniversary of British troops  
entering Northern Ireland.</SUM>
