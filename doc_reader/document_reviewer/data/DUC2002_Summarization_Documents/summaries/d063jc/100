An explosion on 22 September destroyed a military barracks in Deal. Ten men assigned
to the Royal Marines School of Music were killed. The IRA claimed responsibility for
the bombing, the most devastating attack against the British mainland since 1982.

No serious injuries to civilians were reported, but neighboring homes suffered severe
damage.

Private security firms guard the Music School and 29 other "low-risk" military
establishments in Britain. Victims' families and opposition party leaders blamed the
disaster on lax security. Police were seeking three men with Irish accents who lived in the
area for a brief time.</SUM>
