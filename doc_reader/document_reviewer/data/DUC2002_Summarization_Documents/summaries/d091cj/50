Thursday night's flood in Ohio left twenty-one dead, 14 missing and dozens homeless. 
Two creeks outside Shadyside overflowed, knocking homes off their foundations and 
washing away a bar. Authorities said dams formed by debris at bridges broke under 
pressure, creating a "wall of water." Area residents are eligible for federal aid.</SUM>
