A row has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange and the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) over its first inspection of the stockbrokers' books.  SEBI accused 
the brokers of ignoring rules and authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor 
administration.  The exchange denied the charges and called SEBI heavy handed and 
inflexible.  The stock market has fallen 48 percent since early last year including 
dropping 320 points after the Indian budget was announced.  Foreign investors are 
concerned.  This is just the latest in a series of disputes between SEBI--backed by the 
finance minister--and brokers.</SUM>

More than a dozen bombs exploded yesterday afternoon in Bombay, killing about 200 
and injuring more than a 1,000.  The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a 
systematic attack on India's commercial heart.  Targets included the Bombay Stock 
Exchange, Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.  The 
identity of the bombers is unknown, but the goal appears to be renewing communal strife 
and undermining government efforts to attract foreign investment and tourism.  Leaders 
have called for calm.  All roads into Bombay are blocked and the army is on alert.</SUM>

Bombayites are asking who is responsible for the explosions that rocked the city on 
Friday afternoon killing at least 255 and injuring over 1,200.  Residents believe this 
attack was different from the ethnic riots that afflicted the city in December and January.  
The recent attack used high-tech devices and appeared designed to terrorize the nation's 
commercial capital.  Many suspect Moslem extremists, taking revenge for the destruction 
of the Ayodhya mosque, are to blame.  If this found to be true, many will suspect 
Pakistani involvement.  The streets of Bombay are calm, as rubble is being cleared and 
stock exchange authorities prepare to resume trading.</SUM>

Terror struck India again last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of 
apartments in the center of Calcutta.  At least 45 were killed and scores injured.  Identity 
of the bombers is unknown but the explosion is just five days after bombs struck 
Bombay.  A militant Sikh group has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts but 
police remain unconvinced, saying a foreign group was involved.  Many fear these bomb 
attacks are designed to renew communal strife and undermine government efforts to 
attract foreign investment and tourism.  India is still recovering from violence that 
followed the destruction of a mosque in northern India.</SUM>

The Bombay Stock Exchange, hit by two bombs last Friday, reopened Monday with very 
limited trading.  While the index rose on Monday and Tuesday, yesterday's bombing in 
Calcutta, triggered selling.  The Bombay equity market has had a volatile six weeks.  
Bullish speculation over an expected tax cut ended in disappointment when the Indian 
budget was released, cutting short-term capital gains taxes only for expatriate Indians and 
foreign investors.  The BSE-30 share index had plunged until March 10, when a rebound 
started.  Whether it continues depends on foreign investors who are appraising the 
situation.  Local investors have no incentive to sell.</SUM>
