Hurricane Hugo which hit Charleston, S.C. head-on the night of Sept. 21, 1989 was the 
costliest storm in the city's 300-year history. Despite widespread devastation (insured 
losses approached $5 billion) there were only 17 deaths in South Carolina and only two 
in Charleston itself thanks to accurate forecasting in time for an effective evacuation.</SUM>
