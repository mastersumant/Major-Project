On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina head-on with winds at 
135 mph causing extensive property damage, but claiming only 17 lives in all of South 
Carolina and only two in Charleston itself. The relatively low casualties were a result of 
an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective 
evacuation measures and good response from residents. Total insured losses from 
Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but 
insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.</SUM>
