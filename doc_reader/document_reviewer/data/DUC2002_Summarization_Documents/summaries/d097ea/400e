Coast</s>
<s docid="AP890922-0007" num="13" wdcount="28"> Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina 
with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern 
states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.</s>
<s docid="AP890922-0007" num="21" wdcount="34"> The eye was about 10 miles across and 
top winds were still at 135 mph. Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the 
north, causing severe flooding as it moved up the East Coast.</s>
<s docid="AP890922-0007" num="31" wdcount="36"> About 12,000 people had checked into 
83 shelters across the state as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, 
said Bennish Brown, a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 
220 miles northwest of here.</s>
<s docid="AP890922-0167" num="10" wdcount="28"> Supercomputers, satellites and the 
expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path 
Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South 
Carolina coast.</s>
<s docid="AP890922-0167" num="14" wdcount="22"> Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's 
landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was 
predicted in time for evacuation.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="10" wdcount="32"> Residents took forecasters at their 
word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths 
from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities 
said.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="11" wdcount="30"> The storm, which caused billions in 
damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston 
area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0054" num="12" wdcount="13"> ``We just feel very thankful about 
that,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.</s>
<s docid="LA092789-0093" num="20" wdcount="44"> Although claims adjusters are still 
tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured 
property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the 
industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, 
Parsons said .</s>
<s docid="WSJ890927-0018" num="32" wdcount="43"> Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes 
that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel 
enough "financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends," to 
compel them to boost premium rates right away.</s>
<s docid="AP890928-0099" num="9" wdcount="19"> As a way of repaying a kindness dating 
to 1778, Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.</s>
<s docid="AP890928-0099" num="10" wdcount="28"> After Kingston, then New York's 
capital, was burned in October 1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton 
received a letter from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston.</s>
<s docid="AP890928-0099" num="11" wdcount="16"> The letter included nearly 1,000 New 
York pounds to help Kingston residents get through their crisis.</s>
