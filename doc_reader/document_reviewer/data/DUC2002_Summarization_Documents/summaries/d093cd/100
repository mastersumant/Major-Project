Overloading is a major contributor to ferry and passenger boat accidents, particularly in 
the third world.  Ferries in India, Guatemala, Egypt, China and Bangladesh all carried for 
more passengers than authorized, when they sank.  Many deaths more passenger occur to 
those below decks than to those above. Captain error also contributed to accidents.  Other 
accidents have involved poor weather and in one case in Bangladesh, river pirates.  But 
even advanced countries have ferry accidents.  Nineteen U.S. sailors died when an Israeli 
ferry sank while returning the sailors to the USS Saratoga.  No cause for the accident was 
reported.</SUM>
