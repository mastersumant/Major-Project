Authorities charges a ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded 
with New Year's travelers sank off Guatemala' east coast.  Sixty-seven people drowned, 
14 were missing and 46 survived.  The ferry ran out of fuel mid-way in its journey and 
sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.  The ferry captain was slow to 
respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's 
wheel once it was under tow.  The ferry captain radioed that he had taken the wheel just 
as the boat began to capsize.</SUM>

In a single year, four ferry accidents left 320 people dead and at least 8 missing.  Two of 
the ferries had exceeded their capacity.   One ferry taking schoolchildren on a visit to a 
hydroelectric power station sank off Hainan Island.  The ferry capsized before it had gone 
200 yards. The others occurred in the Guangxi region near Vietnam, on the Min River in 
Sichuan province and on the Yangtze River.  The ministry responsible for inland water 
navigation announced that it had begun an investigation into the safety of china's river 
vessels to determine if standards should be tightened.</SUM>

Overcrowding and safety violations caused an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River.   
The ferry accident was said to be India's worst ever.  The ferry was overloaded with 
people and wheat and lacked life jackets.  Authorities believed at least 300 people on the 
lower deck died and about 100 swam to safety.  The boat sank a short time after it sailed 
about 100 yards from shore.  The boat trip is normally used by pilgrims crossing the river 
to worship at a Hindu shrine.  Boat accidents are common during the monsoon season 
when rivers overflow their banks.</SUM>

A ferry sank six miles of the Egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy 
seas.  Four hundred seventy one people are missing in shark invested Red Sea waters and

crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.  The ferry was nearing the end of a 
trip from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia and many of the passengers were returning from off 
season pilgrimages to Mecca.  The ferry inexplicably left standard navigational channels 
and investigators were looking into the course change.  They also want to determine if the

The engineer of a ferry that sank off a Red Sea port, leaving more than 400 people 
missing, denied accusations of widespread negligence on the part of the ship's crew.
Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned 
the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed passengers 
aside to get to the lifeboats.  The ship's engineer acknowledged misconduct by some 
crew members, but said the survival of only 10 of the 71 member crew, indicated 
negligence was not widespread.  The ferry hit a reef and quickly sank.  The ferry was 
returning to Egypt from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.</SUM>

A boat carrying hundreds of Somali refugees struck a reef off Kenya and sank, killing 
more than 130 people.  The ferry carried over 600 people.  Police, navy divers, tourists 
and local residents recovered 130 bodies, but 50 victims were still believed trapped in the 
sunken vessel. It was one of many vessels that brought thousands of Somalis seeking 
refuge to Kenya since rebels over threw the Somali president.  The fighting now appears 
to have largely stopped, but refugees continue to arrive.  Most of those who drowned 
were on the lower deck.  Earlier, 11 Somalis drowned when a boat capsized off the coast 
of Kenya.</SUM>

More than 100 people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river 
junction in southern Bangladesh.  It was carrying more than double its authorized 
capacity of 100 passengers when it sank in 22 feet of water.  Those on the ferry's roof 
swam to safety, but most of those in the hull drowned.  River pirates attacked another 
ferry, throwing six people overboard.  The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as 
passengers, open fire and exploded bombs as people were bedding down for the night. 
The attackers, who made off with about 83,000 in local currency, escaped in waiting 
boats.</SUM>
