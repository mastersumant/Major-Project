In July 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of violating OPEC production quotas 
and stealing oil from wells along the Iraq-Kuwait border. The two countries agreed to 
talks to settle their differences, but on the first day of the talks the Iraqi representatives 
walked out. The next day, August 2, 1990, 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded and quickly 
occupied Kuwait. Despite strong diplomatic efforts, Iraq remained defiant, rounding up 
several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans in Kuwait and taking some of 
them to Iraq. As of August 6, 1990 Iraqi troops were massed on the border of Saudi 
Arabia and the U.S. warned that its vital interests were involved.</SUM>
