An earthquake hit northwestern Iran on June 21, 1990 killing at least 50,000 people and 
leaving 400,000 homeless. The death toll made this the fourth deadliest earthquake 
worldwide in fifty years. The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and exacted 
particularly heavy casualties since it occurred when most people were inside asleep 
and hit a coastal area of loosely deposited soil that shifts, causing the adobe homes in 
the area to collapse. The Iranian President appealed for international aid from all 
countries except Israel and South Africa. Countries around the world, both friendly and 
hostile to Iran's Islamic government, responded quickly. The aid from the United States, 
including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California , was channeled through 
the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This was a rare example of U.S.-Iranian cooperation 
after the hostage crisis of 1979-80. Countries as diverse as Egypt, China, India, 
Malaysia and the Soviet Union sent help. Even Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born author 
of "Satanic Verses," condemned to death by the Iranian ayatollahs, contributed $8,600. 
All was not sweetness and light, however. In Iran an anti-American newspaper blamed 
the high death toll on the United States and in Washington Iranian opposition leaders 
blamed it on the Iranian government.</SUM>
