The earthquake that struck northern Iran Thursday resembled the Armenian earthquake 
of Dec. 7, 1988. Both killed about 25,000 people most of whom died as their fragile 
homes collapsed. The Iranian quake was the stronger measuring 7.7 (vs. 6.9) on the 
Richter scale. The Iranian quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were 
inside asleep when it hit. It occurred in an area where most of the adobe buildings are 
on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts causing structures to collapse. 
Thursday's quake was the strongest ever recorded in that area where two major plates 
of the earth's crust meet.</SUM>

The earthquake that hit Iran early Thursday exacted particularly large casualties 
because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of loosely deposited 
soil that shifts in an earthquake. The quake, measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale, hit a 
mountainous section of coastal Iran at 12:30 a.m. and was the most powerful ever 
recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet. Most structures 
in the area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily. At least 
25,000 died and thousands were injured as residents were buried in the rubble of their 
homes.</SUM>

Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's 
massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of political backlash. 
Speaking before a rally today across the street from the White House in Washington, 
Gobadi claimed that while Iran has reported 36,000 dead, he has received estimates 
closer to 100,000. The government is unable to properly assist earthquake victims, he 
said, because it "has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to 
oppression of the people at home."</SUM>

The 25,000-strong Iranian community in San Diego has responded quickly to the 
earthquake that hit northern Iran on Wednesday, California time. Many have turned 
anxiety over the fate of relatives and friends into action by mobilizing relief efforts, 
setting up two offices (467-1120 and 456-4000) to gather contributions for the United 
Nations Fund for the Iran Earthquake. The Iranian group is collecting medicine, light 
clothing, blankets, and flashlights among other things. Another group collecting medical 
supplies is Southwest Medical Teams (284-7979). Donations for Iranian earthquake 
relief may also be sent to the Red Cross, UNICEF, Bank Meli Iran, and the Adventist 
Development and Relief Agency.</SUM>

Iran today welcomed earthquake relief from its bitter enemy, the United States, but 
specified that aid should be channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent. This 
is one of the very rare instances of U.S. - Iranian cooperation since the countries broke 
diplomatic relations a decade ago. Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all 
countries, including Iraq, but not from  Israel and South Africa. The earthquake which 
hit northern Iran Thursday with a magnitude of 7.3-7.7  killed at least 35,000 and left 
400,000 homeless. More than 6,000 people were pulled from rubble in Gilan and 
Zanjan provinces and airlifted to hospitals.</SUM>

Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced to death by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 
donated $8,600 to victims of last week's devastating earthquake in Iran. Rushdie, in 
hiding because of the Iranian leadership's threat to his life, declared, "It's quite clear 
that at the moment, we should be thinking only of the humanitarian issue, which 
transcends all other discussion." In Tehran Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, known as the

On Sunday an anti-American newspaper in Iran blamed the United States for  tens of 
thousands of deaths in last week's earthquake, claiming that because of the U.S.'s 
plundering of Iran's oil and other resources for 25 years, Iran's national wealth was not 
applied to development of  "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems."  
Later the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and launched "several other plots" that 
halted the renovation of the country. The paper called for rejection of relief offers by the 
U.S. and "other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian 
people." Iran has said it would welcome relief from U.S. humanitarian groups.</SUM>

The estimated 50,000 deaths from the earthquake which hit Iran last Thursday would  
make it the fourth deadliest earthquake worldwide in the last fifty years. The quake 
measured between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale.  The most lives lost in a quake 
during this period was 200,000 reported officially for the quake in China on July 28, 
1976 which measured 8.2 Richter and according to unofficial estimates may have killed 
as many as 800,000. The quake in Soviet Turkmenia on Oct. 5, 1948 of undetermined 
magnitude claimed 110,000 lives. With a magnitude of 7.7, the Peruvian earthquake of 
May 31, 1970 caused 66,794 deaths.</SUM>
