Fighting has broken out sporadically in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir since January 
20.  At least 1,034 people had been killed by late August.  The Indian government is 
battling Muslim insurgents seeking the formation of an independent, neutral, nation.  
India (predominately Hindu) and Pakistan (predominately Islamic) have fought two wars 
over Kashmir since the nations were established in 1947.  Jammu-Kashmir is 62 percent 
Muslim. 
 
Insurgent tactics have included bombings, kidnappings, killings of suspected police 
informers, ambushes of police vehicles, and attacks on police installations.  Large 
demonstrations have been held in Jammu-Kashmir and on the Pakistani border.  Indian 
tactics have include retaliatory fire, arresting and killing insurgent leaders, 24-hour 
curfews, disrupting and firing on demonstrations, and interfering with funerals of dead 
insurgents.  The state is now governed directly from New Delhi.

In August, India increased border forces and operations and killed 80 infiltrators, 
claiming the insurgents are being trained and armed in Pakistan.  Pakistan denies these 
charges but says it does support the Muslims' crusade for "self-determination."  The 
Prime Minister of Pakistan has sought the support of other Islamic nations.  The two 
nations have exchanged fire on several occasions, but both say there is no cause for 
concern.</SUM>
