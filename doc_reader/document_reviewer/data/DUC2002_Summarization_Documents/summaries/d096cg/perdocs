Businesses show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter 
restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.  One big change for 
tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be 
deducted and there must be a "substantial and bona fide business discussion" before, during, or 
after the game.

As long as business is discussed, airfare and lodging are still 100% deductible and means are 
80% deductible.  Banquets get 100% deduction if they have at least 40 persons and a speaker.</SUM>

The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl Sunday with a dramatic 20-16 victory over the 
Cincinnati Bengals.  Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds 
remaining provided the win.  The pass gave Montana a Super Bowl record with 357 yards 
passing.  The victory was achieved through the brilliance of  Montana and Jerry Rice, the wide 
receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards, both Super Bowl records.  Rice was named the 
game's most valuable player.

It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference team and the third Super Bowl 
win for Coach Bill Walsh.</SUM>

President Bush at an East Room reception congratulated the San Francisco 49ers on their 20-16 
Super Bowl victory.  Surrounded by 49ers, Bush said they rewrote the record books and raised 
football to a new level of excellence.  Quarterback Joe Montana said being invited to the White 
House "meant a lot to us all... Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties."

Bush was presented with autographed footballs by Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice, who 
won the game's MVP award; a Super Bowl ring by team owner Danny DeBartolo; and a 49ers 
jogging outfit by Coach Bill Walsh.</SUM>

The nation's two largest brewers, Anheuser Busch Cos., Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., are 
gearing up to sell their beer by staging mock football games in television commercials in 
conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV.  Attempting to take advantage of weeks of hype, both 
companies will spend upwards of $7 million.

Anheuser Busch's "Bud Bowl II" ad campaign will feature animated teams of Budweiser and 
Bud Light beer bottles rattling around on a pint-sized football field.

Miller's 12-week pre-Super Bowl campaign will center on a football game between a "Tastes 
Great" team and a "Less Filling" squad featuring NFL players.</SUM>

The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super 
Bowl victory ever.  This was the 49ers fourth win in four tries, tying them with the Pittsburgh 
Steelers for the NFL championship.  San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana set several Super 
Bowl records; five touchdown passes; 13 straight pass completions; a third Super Bowl MVP 
award.  San Francisco's point total was the most ever.  In four Super Bowls, Montana has thrown 
11 touchdowns and no interceptions.

It was a day of futility for Broncos' quarterback John Elway as his team suffered its third Super 
Bowl defeat.</SUM>

The San Francisco 49ers 55-10 rout of the Denver Broncos was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 
21 years and the third lowest ever since the 1969 and 1968 Super Bowls.  The game averaged a 
39.0 rating and 63 share.  The rating is a percentage of the nation's televisions; each point 
represents 921,000 homes.  The share is the percentage of TVs on at the time.

Despite the low rating, about 108.5 million watched the game, making it the ninth most-watched 
TV show ever behind eight Super Bowls and the final episode of MASH.  Higher viewership 
was due to the annual increase in the number of homes with TV.</SUM>

Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched TV event of the week, viewed by 63% of the viewers. 
CBS estimates 109 million viewers, down only 2 million from last year, despite the fact that this 
year's match was a blowout and resulted in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969.

Each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did two decades 
ago. Technically, Super Bowl IV in 1970 out rated Super Bowl XXIV 39.4 to 39.0.  But 
Sunday's game had almost twice the estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat 
Minnesota 20 years ago.</SUM>

The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993, 
will offer the stadium rent free to the National Football League along with all income from 
concessions and sales of novelty items.  The Council selected the Rose Bowl because it has 
103,083 seats.  Under a joint agreement, Anaheim Stadium and the Coliseum did not submit bids 
but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game.  The share is still being 
negotiated.  One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds; the other two 
sharing 25%.</SUM>

Henry Carley, president of Tampa's local chapter of the NAACP, is co-chairman of one of the 
feature events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, an extravaganza with marching bands, 
a street festival, and floats.  Carley's efforts calmed a racial dispute over Tampa's traditional 
white-dominated Gasparilla Parade, which had to be cancelled.

The Super Bowl Task Force this year named two black men to head a community-relations 
committee.  Carley said there is much more involvement this time, black and white, than the 
1984 event.  There will be an event saluting black sports legends.  Several minority-owned 
businesses won lucrative contracts with the NFL.</SUM>
