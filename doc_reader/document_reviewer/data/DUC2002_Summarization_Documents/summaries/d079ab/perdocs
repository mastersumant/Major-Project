Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday with sustained winds of 
75 mph gusting to 92 mph.  Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral alerted the country's 
heavily populated south coast and cautioned that even though there is no need for alarm, 
residents should closely follow Gilbert's movements.  The U.S.  Weather Service issued a 
flash flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.  
Gilbert brought coastal flooding to Puerto Rico's south coast on Saturday.  There have 
been no reports of casualties.  Meanwhile, Hurricane Florence, the second hurricane of 
this storm season, was downgraded to a tropical storm.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100 mph winds, and officials 
issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and 
Cuba.  Hal Gerrish, with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said, "It's 
still gaining strength.  It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean 
for a long time.'  The governments of Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica issued warnings.  In 
Puerto Rico, the storm injured three people, tore off several roofs, caused coastal flooding 
and brought down trees and power lines in the west and southwest regions.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5, one of the strongest storms in history battered the 
Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.  It was the worst disaster in 
Jamaica's modern history and will take some time to assess its full damage.  The storm 
measured 26.13 inches of barometric pressure, the lowest ever measured in the Western 
Hemisphere.  Oil companies rushed to evacuate about 10,000 oilrigs in the Caribbean.  
With phones knocked out, ham radio operators in Jamaica reported that people who were 
trying to enter the Wyndam Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay at the height of the storm 
were swept into the ocean.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert, a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph and the lowest barometric 
pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, may be the most intense hurricane 
ever recorded.  Although records of geographical size are not kept, it may also be the 
largest.  The other two are Hurricane Camille in 1969 that bulldozed the Mississippi coast 
with a 28 foot wave, leaving 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead, and the Labor Day 
storm of 1935.  Still, the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, killing more than 6000 
people, was a hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas on Sept. 8, 1900.</SUM>

Dateline: September 14, 1988.  Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest in history, now 
moving toward Texas, battered the Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel today with 
160 mph winds and torrential rains.  Military and civilian teams evacuated more than 
16,000 people from the resort coastal areas.  Receptionist, Pablo Torres of the Carrillos 
Hotel in Cancun reported "there is not one tourist now in the hotel zone".  The hurricane 
hit the Yucatan after battering other Caribbean countries, particularly the Dominican 
Republic and Jamaica, where it has been called the worst natural disaster in history.</SUM>

Gilbert, the most intense hurricane ever recorded, surged toward Texas today after 
battering the Yucatan Peninsula, leveling homes, pummeling posh resorts and forcing 
tens of thousands to flee.  The entire Texas coast and the northeast Mexican coast are on 
hurricane watch.  Earlier this week the storm ravaged Jamaica, killing 19 and destroying 
about 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.  The Dominican Republic, where 5 died, the 
Cayman Islands and Haiti were also hit hard.  In Mexico, the cities of Merida, Puerto 
Progreso, Campeche, Ciudad el Carmen and Cancun were most affected, as were the 
resort islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres where 15,000 remain stranded.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert, after devastating Jamaica and then the Yucatan Peninsula, has been 
downgraded from Category 5 to Category 3 but may again gather strength over water 
while moving west-northwest toward landfall.  A warning has been issued for Mexico's 
northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast.  The Texas Governor 
dispatched the National Guard and has issued an emergency proclamation "to preserve 
the health, safety and welfare of the public".  Homeowners are boarding up and laying in 
supplies to protect against this massive hurricane, which, to date, has taken at least 47 
lives in the Caribbean and caused over $8 billion in damage.</SUM>

Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a Tropical Storm today along the Texas-Mexico border.  
Earlier this week, it left at least 109 people dead and 800,000 homeless throughout the 
Caribbean and parts of Mexico.  The more fortunate Gulf Coast residents expressed relief 
even though it sparked dozens of tornadoes that caused one death and some injuries and 
property damage.  Evacuees are anxious to get home, but officials still warn of dangerous 
flash flooding while the storm moves along as a "huge rain-making machine".  It should 
now track up the Mississippi River Valley to end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more 
than foul weather.</SUM>

Although Hurricane Gilbert had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides 
after it reentered Mexico on Friday.  After more than 24 hours of rain, the Santa Catarina 
River overflowed its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths 
and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros.  The police officers were 
on a rescue mission around midnight when they died.  The hurricane has killed more than 
109 people and the death toll is expected to rise.  Although the worst appears over, in 
many locations, hurricane victims are without food, drinking water, electricity, gasoline 
and communications.</SUM>
