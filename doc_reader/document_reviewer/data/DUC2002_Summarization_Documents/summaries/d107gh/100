In mid-July, 1988's drought looked record-breaking. Further drought was predicted based 
on past records. Severe storms brought tornadoes, hail damage, and lightning-sparked 
fires. States issued heat alerts. Weather experts who attended a Drought Symposium 
urged continued attention to climate and greenhouse-effect reduction. Crop declines were 
forecast and grain futures fell. Adequate domestic and export supplies were expected. 
UPS, railroads, and truckers transported hay for free. Federal aid, state loans to farmers, 
and eased future crop controls were proposed. Reagan visited drought areas. Farmers 
sued reneging insurers. Drinking water was hauled in and dam flows reduced. Livestock 
sales increased. Cannery, mill, and  logging jobs fell. Highway projects were accelerated.</SUM>
