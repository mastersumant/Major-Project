In August 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida, and Louisiana 
leaving 19 dead and extensive property damage. In Florida a quarter of a million were 
left homeless. The cost to insurers, concentrated in U.S. companies, was estimated as 
high as $20 billion and much of the damaged property was not insured. Federal 
authorities promised emergency aid after Florida officials complained of delays in 
supplying food and water. The cost of rebuilding Florida and caring for those displaced 
by the storm was estimated at $20-$30 billion. Fortunately the storm did not hit low-lying 
New Orleans or oil facilities along the gulf coast.</SUM>
