General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses 
from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million; however, GA has only a half-percent 
share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that GA's
catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims. The company's loss 
adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion. Other insurers have 
estimated that losses from the storm that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere 
from $1 billion to $20 billion. At this time no one is certain of the extent of losses.</SUM>

Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida Monday morning, was moving north-west across 
the Gulf of Mexico yesterday, and now threatens New Orleans and the coast from 
Mississippi to Texas. At least three people were killed by the storm in the Bahamas 
Sunday and twelve in Florida Monday. Two million people have been advised to move 
from the threatened coastal areas. Although it is too early to assess the cost of the 
storm, one official estimates $15 billion to $20 billion of damage already. Most of the 
insurance claims from damage in Florida and Louisiana will be filed with State Farm, 
Allstate, and American International Group insurance companies.</SUM>

Hurricane Andrew, which killed 15 people and left a quarter of a million people 
homeless in south Florida, hit sparsely populated farming communities and swampland 
in Louisiana killing two people and injuring less than 100. Most Louisiana oil refineries 
were not affected. In Florida local officials were critical of delays in supplying food, 
drinking water, and other supplies to thousands in need. Transportation Secretary 
Andrew Card promised "dramatic" improvements within 24 hours and President Bush 
ordered troops to Florida. The government estimated it would cost $20 billion to $30 
billion to rebuild in Florida and care for those displaced by the storm.</SUM>

Last night U.S. cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on 
storm watch for Hurricane Andrew which early yesterday caused at least eight deaths 
and heavy property damage in southern Florida.  Florida Power estimates that 1.2 
million of its customers are without power. There was concern last night that the 
hurricane might hit New Orleans which is especially vulnerable because of its low-lying 
location. It could also threaten offshore oil production facilities along the Gulf coast of 
Louisiana and Texas. A British insurance adjuster estimates that total losses, 
concentrated among U. S. Insurers, could exceed $15 billion.</SUM>

Hurricane Andrew yesterday smashed its way through Louisiana causing heavy 
damage in rural communities but missing low-lying New Orleans. After hitting Louisiana 
with winds up to 120 miles per hour, Andrew lost force and by yesterday afternoon was 
down-graded to a tropical storm. Early reports indicate one death, 75 injuries, and 
thousands homeless in Louisiana after 14 deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. 
Across Florida 2 million people were without electricity yesterday. There was more than 
$15 billion property damage in Florida, but most of it was to uninsured property, so 
insurers' losses are likely to total less than $1 billion.</SUM>

Both Hurricane Andrew and a dollar crisis blew themselves out this week. Most of the 
damage from the dollar crisis came a week ago Friday and the following Monday when 
bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones average dropped by more than 75 
points. The dollar dropped to DM 1.40, the lowest ever against the D-mark after buildup 
over the summer in the difference between U. S. and German interest rates. The effect 
of Hurricane Andrew on Wall Street was not surprising. The stocks of insurance 
companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida tumbled while those of home 
construction companies showed sharp gains.</SUM>
