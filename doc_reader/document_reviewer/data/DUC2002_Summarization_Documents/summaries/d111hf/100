Severe weather at sea, faulty ship design, unseen obstacles, and hostile
action are some of the many reasons that ships sink.  At times, ships are
sunk deliberately, by a dishonest owner in an insurance scam or by a naval
crew in wartime to foil an enemy or by a crew to conceal illegal activities.
Loss of life very often accompanies a ship=B9s sinking.  Efforts to locate
sunken ships are undertaken to determine why the ship went down and,
sometimes, in the hope of recovering treasure.  Ships sinking are not
uncommon events. In 1993, over 100 vessels went under.</SUM>
