On Wednesday, Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type, 
slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula with 160mph winds causing heavy damage to the 
resort areas of Cancun and Cozumel.  More than 120,000 people on the northeast 
Yucatan coast were evacuated.  Earlier the storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and 5 in the 
Dominican Republic.  It destroyed and estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.  
Mexican officials were often helpless as floods closed roads and downed power lines 
disrupted phone service.  The already record-setting storm is expected to intensify as it 
leaves the Yucatan and again moves over water.</SUM>

Scientists do not know what fuels a budding hurricane as development begins.  It is a 
mysterious convergence of winds, moisture and temperature near the equator.  About one 
out of six of the 50 to 60 low-pressure troughs moving west out of Africa each year 
develop into a higher level storm.  A tropical trough, or wave, becomes a depression 
when its winds start swirling.  When sustained winds reach 39mph, the system becomes a 
named tropical storm.  It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74mph.  
Scientists believe that hurricanes' primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the 
upper atmosphere.</SUM>
