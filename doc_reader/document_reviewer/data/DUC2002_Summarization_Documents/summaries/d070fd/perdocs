Erich Honecker, the former head of East Germany, died on 29 May 1994 in Santiago 
Chile.  The 81-year-old Honecker and his wife Margot Honecker, had been living with 
their daughter in Santiago, since his release from prison in 1993.  Honecker had been 
suffering from liver cancer.  Honecker's lawyer, Nicolas Becker said that while he had 
refused an operation, Honecker had done everything sensible in regard to treatment.  It is 
not clear whether or not Margot Honecker will be allowed to remain in Chile.  It was not 
known if Honecker had left a will or where the funeral would be held.</SUM>

As protests gathered strength in the fall of 1989, East Germany's longtime orthodox 
leader, Erich Honecker "lost touch with reality" according to the man who succeeded him 
as Communist leader only to be ousted later.  Egon Krenz, the successor and former 
Politburo member Guenter Schabowski gave their versions of the bunker mentality that 
engulfed Honecker.

A commission is probing possible criminal charges stemming from police brutality 
during demonstrations by dissident citizens in October 1989. Honecker was driven from 
office 10 days later.  Krenz, who was thrown out 6 weeks after succeeding Honecker, said 
he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators.</SUM>

Former East German leader, Erich Honecker, may be moved to a monastery to protect 
him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens.  He is under investigation for 
corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.  He was placed under house arrest 
in December 1989.  Both Lutheran and Catholic churches have offered Honecker refuge. 
It was the churches that became venues for pro-democracy groups that eventually brought 
the overthrow of Honecker's 18 year leadership.  Recently, East German groups have 
called for punishing Honecker and moving him to smaller quarters.  The current 
leadership fears that in such a situation, Honecker might be attacked.</SUM>

Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested Monday morning morning upon 
release from hospital and taken to prison.  Honecker, who expected to be indicted for 
high treason, was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburg prison.  He had 
previously been declared to ill to withstand imprisonment.  Honecker, the aging hard-line 
Stalinist who ruled East Germany for 18 years, had recently undergone surgery for a 
malignant kidney tumor.   Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker

Former East German leader Erich Honecker and Erich Mielke, former head of the secret 
police, were interrogated by federal prosecutors about their role in killings of people who 
tried to flee the country.  More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines 
as they tried to escape East Germany's Communist rule.  Honecker, 77 and in failing 
health, has already been charged with corruption and abuse of power.  The murder charge 
could put Honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution 
questionable.  He was toppled from power in October 1989 following pro-democracy

East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail, 
but is fit enough to be tried.  Honecker is still recovering from kidney cancer surgery and 
is not well enough to be incarcerated.   Honecker 77, ruled  East Germany for 19 years 
until he was ousted in October 1989 as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations led to a 
peaceful overthrow of the Communist government. Honecker and seven others are

A ranking member of Chairman's Helmut Kohl's party demanded that the Soviet Union 
turn over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter 
charges.  A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, for issuing shoot-
to-kill orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.  Honecker has denied 
all charges against him, including that he was responsible for the estimated 200 people 
who died trying to escape East Germany.   Honecker's fate is one of the first issues 
facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two

Michail Gorbachev urged all sides to take their time in deciding the fate of Erich 
Honecker as former East German leader spent a seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean 
Embassy in Moscow.  Germany wants to try Honecker for ordering the shooting of 
people who attempted to flee to the West during his years in power.  But speculation 
lingers that German politicians have little interest in trying a man who may possess 
embarrassing secrets.   Gorbachev did not exclude the possibility that Honecker would 
leave for North Korea in the next few days.  Outside the Chilean Embassy, several dozen 
demonstrators demanded humane treatment for Honecker.</SUM>

prosecutor said he will be tried for high treason in March.  Honecker was detained after

ouster in October.  Eleven members of Honecker's ousted Politburo already are in prison 
awaiting trial, however his doctor repeated that Honecker is still not well enough to be
