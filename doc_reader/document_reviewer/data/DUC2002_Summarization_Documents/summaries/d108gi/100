After two weeks of accusations and maneuvering, Iraq invaded tiny Kuwait on August 2 
with 100,000 battle-trained troops, quickly taking the country.  While the Kuwaiti emir 
and refugees fled to Saudi Arabia, Iraq began rounding up foreign nationals and 
repopulating the nation with Iraqi citizens.  Some foreigners were taken to Iraq, while 
some were flown to Jordan.  Reactions to the invasion have been strong. The United 
Nations Security Council unanimously passed trade and military sanctions and President 
Bush said he would defend U.S. interests.  Iran rejoiced.  Most nations are strongly 
enforcing these sanctions as oil prices soar and Iraq begins defensive preparations.</SUM>
