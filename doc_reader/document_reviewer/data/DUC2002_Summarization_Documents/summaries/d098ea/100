Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) aboard on April 24, 1990. Deployment of the telescope 
was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the 
Challenger accident.  Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST 
still presented some problems, by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above 
the earth's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 
times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. The Discovery astronauts were 
permitted to return to Earth.</SUM>
