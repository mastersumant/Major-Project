Deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), originally scheduled for 1983, was 
delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident in 1986 and did not take 
place until April 1990. The HST had two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter and the 
other 12 inches. Electrical power was provided by two wing-like solar arrays. It was 
named after Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is 
constantly expanding. Scientists regarded the telescope as the greatest advance in 
astronomy since Galileo, providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more 
sensitivity than ground-based observatories.  A successful launch of space shuttle 
Discovery with the HST aboard took place at 8:34 a.m. April 24, 1990 and Discovery 
ascended into orbit 380 miles above Earth. On April 25 the HST was placed in orbit on 
its own with Discovery trailing behind to provide astronaut assistance if needed. The 
HST's aluminum aperture door was successfully opened on April 27 exposing the 
telescope's 94.5- inch mirror to starlight. By April 28 there were still problems with the 
electronic and communications systems, but procedures were in place to take care of 
these, the HST was in orbit, and the Discovery astronauts prepared for return to earth 
on April 29, 1990.</SUM>
