<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="7" wdcount="28"> Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within

<s docid="LA102489-0131" num="8" wdcount="44"> With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims 
need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share 
of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is 
practical.</s>

<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="9" wdcount="34"> Most San Francisco-area 
homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own 
pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher 
rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="AP891018-0301" num="11" wdcount="26"> The Association of California Insurance Cos. in

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="10" wdcount="32"> Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task 
than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and 
the Carolinas last month.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="12" wdcount="33"> But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the 
earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two 
years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.</s> 

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="35" wdcount="17"> Indeed, the earthquake could contribute 
to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="36" wdcount="20"> For example, insurers may seek to limit 
their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance 
they buy.</s> 

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="37" wdcount="35"> Such increased demand 
for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two 
disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be 
translated into an overall price rise.</s>
