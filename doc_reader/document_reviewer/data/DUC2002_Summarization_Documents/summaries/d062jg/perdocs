Analysts and industry spokesmen say most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay out 
of their own pockets for Tuesday's earthquake.  About two-thirds of earthquake insurance 
policies in the US are sold in California.  However, only about 25 to 30% of the homes in the 
earthquake-prone San Francisco area have earthquake insurance. 

Insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more but no company is expected to suffer serious 
financial damage.  It is predicted that the quake damages may in fact lead to rate hikes, although 
insurers and state legislators are battling over the rates and how they are set.</SUM>

In the aftermath of California's earthquake, the White House flew into a whirlwind of activity 
yesterday--partly to get federal aid flowing--but also to project an image of a White House in 
action.  President Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly to the Exxon Valdez 
oil tanker spill and Hurricane Hugo.

Mr. Bush was briefed early, signed a disaster proclamation, and visited the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) where he said he hoped there would be "less carping" about the 
agency's performance this time, adding that it "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.</SUM>

Insurers may have to pay billions of dollars for this weekend's California earthquake.  The 
damage goes far beyond that of Hurricane Hugo along the Carolinas last month.  But investors 
hope the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake will stem the price-cutting wars 
between insurers the past two years.

Insurers are rushing into the area to process claims.  About 25% of the policyholders have 
earthquake insurance.  The claims are not expected to cause significant financial problems for 
the insurers as a whole.  They are likely to increase the amount of reinsurance they buy, which 
will translate into an overall price rise.</SUM>

Various persons witnessing the recent San Francisco earthquake conveyed their reactions as 
follows:

"It's like a blind man trying to feel an elephant.  We're just now figuring out bits and pieces of 
this disaster." (Member, California Seismic Safety Commission)

"Usually earthquakes pass, but this one went on and on.  It just wouldn't stop..It was very, very 
bad." (Schoolteacher, Silicon Valley)


"At first I thought the smoke was fog.  Then I could see a big ball of flame." (Driver, coming 
from Sonoma)

"This upper deck was absolutely shaking, the light stanchions were blowing back and forth."

Governor George Deukmejian of California is right in calling for a session of the Legislature to 
assure victims that the state will provide its share of aid as soon as possible and without a lot of 
red tape.  The governor is wrong, however, in distancing himself from the California Department 
of Transportation (Caltran) concerning what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse. 
The governor, claiming he wasn't told that a freeway might collapse in an earthquake, may be 
defending his opposition to a gasoline tax increase that could have funded highway development.</SUM>
