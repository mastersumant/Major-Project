The worst earthquake in this region since 1950, registering 6.5 on the Richter scale, hit 
near the Nepal-India border killing at least 750 and injuring thousands.  Earthquake 
damage and monsoon rains have paralyzed rail and road transportation thus hindering 
rescue efforts and isolating some remote areas.  Aftershocks kept people terrified for 
days.</SUM>
