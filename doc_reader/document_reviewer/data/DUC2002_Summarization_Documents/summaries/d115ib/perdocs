and collapsing buildings.  First reports said 100 people may have died.  Nepal's 
Department of Geology said the earthquake measured 5.7 on the Richter scale.  The 
quake, lasting about 40 seconds, was centered near Udayapur, a town near the Indian-
Nepalese border and 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, Nepal's capital.  The quake was 
also felt in the Indian capital of New Delhi and Calcutta, but there were no reports of 
casualties.  In New Delhi, the Seismological Observatory said the quake measured 6.5 on

The deadliest earthquake to strike the region since 1950 triggered landslides and 
destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border area early Sunday, killing at 
least 237 people and injuring more than 1500.  The U.S. Geological Survey office in 
Golden, Colorado recorded the quake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter 
scale, with its epicenter 100 miles southeast of Katmandu.  Both countries believe the 
death toll will rise when reports come in from the rural areas.  Monsoon rains are 
hampering rescue operations.  The town of Darbhanga in India's Bihar state appears to be 
the worst hit area.</SUM>

Rescue workers coped with aftershocks and heavy rain in their efforts to reach remote 
Himalayan region victims of an earthquake whose official death toll neared 700, with at 
least 2,000 people injured in India and 1,000 in Nepal.  Although the intensity of 
aftershocks is lessening, people remain frightened.  In Nepal's cities of Katmandu and 
Biratnagar, and in Patna, India, rumors of expected new quakes sent thousands of people 
into the streets.  Indian and Nepalese military and police helped with relief efforts.  
Nepalese officials said many offers of assistance had come from abroad but no decision 
was made about accepting them.</SUM>

Rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-
third of Nepal and parts of India, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands.  
Officials in both countries said they had not yet received reports from the remote 
Himalayan areas hardest hit by the tremors.  In eastern Nepal, 50,000 to 60,000 houses 
were destroyed in the Dharan district alone.  Monsoons, earthquake damage and 
aftershocks have paralyzed train service and road travel hampering relief efforts.  In 
India, more than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga and Munger, and in the 
district of Madhubani nearly 50 villages were flooded.</SUM>

In Nepal, police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to 
homes left unsafe by a devastating earthquake.  At least 531 people were killed in Nepal.  
India's official death toll of 200 is disputed by news media and opposition politicians 
who put the death count 400 and 1,500.  Most deaths occurred in victim's houses, which 
were made of brick held together by mud that had been loosened by monsoon rains.  In 
India, helicopters ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police trapped in 
Bihar, India's poorest state.  In Nepal, rice was being distributed to quake-affected 
families.</SUM>

Nepalese police have bulldozed more than 50 brick and mud houses that have been made 
unstable by an earthquake that struck near the India-Nepal border and killed at least 749 
people.  Police said they will continue demolishing houses until satisfied that those 
remaining are safe to live in.  Most homeless have moved in with neighbors or found 
shelter in tents while waiting to hear from the government about compensation or new 
homes.  Prime Minister Shrestha while visiting Nepal's hardest hit town, Dharan, on 
Tuesday said, "This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal."  The quake registered 6.5 on

At least 562 people died in Nepal on Sunday and 196 in India when the deadliest 
earthquake since 1950 hit their border region.  Residents ran terrified on Wednesday in 
both Bihar state, the worst hit area of India, and in Dharan, the worst hit area of Nepal, as 
aftershocks were felt.  No new damage was suffered in either place.  In India's Bihar state 
rivers are rising.  Authorities found cracks in the embankments of six of them.  Floods 
could be the next threat.  Foreign aid began arriving.  The U.S., Britain and the U.N. are

The parents of a Peace Corps worker learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in 
Nepal, was safe following and earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750 people in 
that country and neighboring India.  Another Peace Corps worker, Bettyjean Bouffard 
also called her relatives to say she was safe.  She had been living with a Nepalese family 
five miles from the earthquake epicenter.  The Peace Corps has been able to track down 
all but three of its volunteers in Nepal.  Monsoon rains and washed-out roads kept them 
from reaching some of the volunteers.  There aren't any Peace Corps volunteers in India.</SUM>

An earthquake that measured 6.5 on the Richter scale devastated parts of Nepal and India 
earlier this week, killing more than 980 people.  In Bhaktapur, Nepal, mourners called for 
revenge after political rivals beat a former legislator to death while he was distributing 
relief supplies to earthquake victims.  Karna Hyanju, once a Communist Party 
sympathizer, was beaten and then dragged through the streets for nearly two hours before 
police intervened.  He was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief 
supplies only to his own supporters.  Several people have been arrested in the killing, 
including the mayor.</SUM>
