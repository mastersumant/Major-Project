The US had its worst Winter Olympic showing in 52 years the1988 Games with
few medal winners.  In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the US faired better
but was still outpaced by the Soviets.  Those games were marred by drug
usage and suffered from poor TV coverage.  US medal winners included the
flamboyant Florence Griffith Joiner, her sister-in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
Greg Louganis, and Carl Lewis.  An earlier Olympic hero, the late Jesse
Owens was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.  The more affluent
nations continue to dominate in the Olympics, especially in relay events.</SUM>
