Paying unexpected calls on Wal-Mart stores is one way Chairman Sam Walton has kept 
in touch with everyday happenings.  Other Wal-Mart executives follow his example.  
Walton's personality permeates operations and his whole family is in the business.  
People say Sam is as old-fashioned and homespun as his principles, which declare the 
customer is always right.  He is happy to chat with customers, but shuns the press 
especially when asked about his massive fortune.  Walton turns 71 in March.  He was 
born in Oklahoma, the son of a mortgage banker.  He opened Wal-Mart Discount City in 
1962.  The rest is history.</SUM>

Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton helped the check-out clerks in his Fort Walton Beach, 
Florida store on Tuesday evening.  He was visiting when a computer problem shut down 
the cash registers, so he took a note pad and started writing down prices for customers so 
their bills could be added more quickly.  Many recognized him and he shook hands and 
chatted.  Walton, 71, is known for his down-home style and surprise visits.  He had come 
to the Fort Walton Beach store to attend a promotional concert in its parking lot.  Walton 
stayed for the concert and led the Wal-Mart cheer.</SUM>

Although he is ranked as the richest man in the nation, Sam Walton is just another 
neighbor to folks in Bentonville, Arkansas.  The founder to the third-largest retail chain 
prefers bird hunting, tennis, and opening new stores to talking about his money.  For the 
third year in a row, Forbes magazine named him among the top billionaires in the world, 
with an estimated $8.7 billion.  Forbes first listed Walton as the richest man in the nation 
in 1985, drawing worldwide attention to Bentonville.  Walton has declined to comment.  
He reportedly spends four days a week visiting stores and talking to employees.</SUM>

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday, 40 years after Sam Walton 
opened a business in the same building in Bentonville, Arkansas.  The center chronicles 
the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain.  After working for the J.C. Penney 
Co. and a tour in the army, Walton opened a Ben Franklin Store in nearby Newport.  He 
moved to Bentonville in 1950.  He opened more Ben Franklin Stores, but the company 
did not like his plan for discount stores in rural areas.  Walton and his brother opened the 
first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.  By  early 1990 Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores and 
employed 272,000.</SUM>

Sam Walton is arguably the most important retailer of his generation.  The owner of a 
general store in the backwaters of Arkansas in 1950 became the world's largest retailer, 
with annual sales of almost $44 billion.  Success can be attributed to Walton's personality 
and his willingness to challenge retailing orthodoxy.  He was a frugal, modest, hard-
working man, who made pop-in visits and delivered pep talks.  Employee satisfaction 
was a vital ingredient, with bonus payments and profit-sharing plans.  Also essential is 
Wal-Mart's year around high-volume, cut-price selling.  Walton proved discount stores 
could be successful in rural towns and drove out hundreds of small main-street stores.</SUM>

"Made in America: My Story" is Sam Walton autobiography and tells how he negotiated 
the pitfalls of being America's richest entrepreneur and a folk hero.  Walton, who died of 
cancer in April, was a dull, happily married, folksy, quail hunter.  Some question 
Walton's anti-union policies, the impact of Wal-Mart on Mom and Pop stores, and 
exploits of his children, but his book is all about "good ole" common sense and 
anecdotes.  He presents himself as an energetic, competitive, engaging, if one-
dimensional, character.  Publishers paid $4 million for him to have his final say.  Some 
may find it dreary and downbeat.</SUM>

Some may say "Wal-Mart: A History of Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon" by Sandra 
Vance and Roy Scott profiles the American Dream.  Walton became one of the world's 
most successful businessmen, leaving the second-largest fortune in the world.  Most 
phenomenal was the rapid growth of the company, going from 38 stores to the largest in 
America in 20 years.  This scholarly work identifies Wal-Mart's ability to copy and 
adapt, staying open to new technology, and building the most efficient retail distribution 
system.  It highlights the streamlined, rapidly responding, management and includes the 
debate on whether Wal-Mart's impact on small towns was positive or negative.</SUM>
