debts. His son Maxwell, who is the publisher of the Daily Mirror, and another son, Ian, are under

office. Malcolm Pein, master chess player and director of chess and bridge, told of Maxwell's 
support of the game when he sponsored a section of the World Chess championships in New 
York.  Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses when Pergamon sold to Elsevier

Maxwell empire, Chess and Bridge has not moved to new premises in London. </SUM>

The opening of a musical about the late Robert Maxwell may be delayed if the attorney general, 
Sir Nicholas Lyell QC has his way. He has applied to the high court for an injunction to halt the 
production, fearing that it would prejudice the trial against Maxwell's two sons, Kevin and Ian. 
The musical is being produced by Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private 
companies. Mr. Steadman indicated that he intended for the show to go on and would contest the 
application for an injunction. Press coverage of the late publisher is already of concern to the 
lawyers for the Maxwell brothers.</SUM>

negotiating to by a U.S. newspaper. Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but speculation 
centered on USA Today, the New York Daily News, or the Chicago Sun-Times. The Daily News, 
with one of the largest circulations in the country has been struggling to compete in a market with 
three other dailies. Others suggested that Maxwell might be trying for USA Today as a way to 
further his efforts to print and distribute his pan-European English-language newspaper, The 
European. in the United States. Maxwell recently purchased three U.S. tabloids; the Globe, the 
National Examiner, and the Sun.</SUM>

In an effort to raise funds, Maxwell Communications Corporation made late payments on the 
foreign market. Called teaming and lading, Maxwell and his son Kevin began to buy and sell 
enormous amounts of foreign currencies. Maxwell would buy currency in one financial center 
and promise to repay it in another. MCC received the currency, but on a number of occasions, did 
not make the payment, giving itself an unauthorized loan. About 20 banks, including Lloyds, 
Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Swiss Bank Corporation were involved in the exchange 
deals. At least 100m dollars in credit is thought to have been raised this way.</SUM>
