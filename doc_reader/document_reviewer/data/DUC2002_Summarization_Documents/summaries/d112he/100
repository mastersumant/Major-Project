Economic confusion surrounds the mysterious death of publishing magnate Robert 
Maxwell. Maxwell, who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to 
Britain in 1940, was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently 
having fallen overboard from his yacht. There are allegations that Maxwell, along with 
two of his sons, Kevin and Ian, and a senior executive in several Maxwell corporations, 
Michael Stoney, were involved in the illegal transfer of funds to help his publishing 
empire fend off debt. The scheme used Swiss trusts and a number of institutions, 
including the U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs.</SUM>
