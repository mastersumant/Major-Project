Robert Maxwell has been described as the Citizen Kane of his time. The mysterious 
death of this larger than life individual on November 5 has left the economic affairs of 
Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers is a state of 
confusion. Maxwell was born in Czechoslovakia and immigrated to Britain in 1940 to 
escape the Holocaust. He put together and personally ran world-wide publishing empire 
that included Macmillan Publishing House in New York, Britain's Daily mirror, the 
Daily Record and the European and British Printing Company, and communications 
Corp., Britain's largest printing company. Improprieties have been alleged in the 
handling of funds which involve not only Robert Maxwell, but two of his sons, Kevin 
and Ian, as well as Michael Stoney, an executive in several Maxwell companies. At issue 
is the alleged improper transfer of funds in an attempt to handle his publishing empire's 
crushing debts. Among the interests named in the transfer of funds to two Swiss trusts, is 
the U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs. Maxwell also is accused of using MCC in an 
effort to raise funds by making late payments on the foreign market. In doing so, MCC in 
effect gave itself an unauthorized loan.</SUM>
