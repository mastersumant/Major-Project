On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, S.C. head-on causing extensive 
property damage, but hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by hurricane 
forecasters and emergency workers who facilitated a massive evacuation before the 
storm hit. Scientists warn that global warning could cause hurricanes much stronger 
than Hugo in the future.</SUM>
