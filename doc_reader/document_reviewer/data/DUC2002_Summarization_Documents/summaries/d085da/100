After killing 20 and leaving about 100,000 homeless in the Caribbean, Hurricane Hugo 
hit Charleston, S.C. head-on at midnight of Sept. 21, 1989 with winds of 135 mph. 
Although seventeen were killed in the Carolinas and property damage there exceeded 
$750 million, hundreds or thousands of lives were saved by advance warning of the 
storm from the National Hurricane Center and prompt response of officials and the 
populace. Scientists have warned that if global warning should cause sea temperature 
to rise 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit, we may well experience future hurricanes with half 
again the strength of Category 4 Hugo.</SUM>
