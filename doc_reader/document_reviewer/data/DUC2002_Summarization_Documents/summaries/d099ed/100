Marathons attract both professional athletes as well as amateur runners.  Some 
marathons, such as Los Angeles', concentrate on the commercial and moneymaking side 
of marathons, while other cities such as New York, Boston and San Francisco attract 
world-class runners.  Still others, such as the Marine Corps marathon which bills itself as 
the "people's race," are just for the sport.  Tour companies sponsor international trips 
organized around marathons, offering clients a chance to run in some of the most popular 
marathons in the world.  Age is no barrier to marathon running.  John Kelley, 83, plans to 
run in the Boston marathon.</SUM>
