The Los Angeles marathon has a marketing orientation rather than that of a first class 
athletic event.  In only 5 years, it has become the best marketed, slickest, most modern 
and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.  The lineup of commercial support is 
impressive.   Mercedes-Benz, along with other sponsors, provides the race with the bulk 
of its operating budget.  The marketing approach makes the race lucrative, but it does not 
give it prestige or attract the world's best runners.  Organizers of the marathon expect to 
increase this year's total purse of $202,520 by $100,000 next year.</SUM>

The Los Angeles marathon is a commercial spectacle.  It has been designed to make 
money for the closely held company that controls it as well as for the city.  More than 
18,000 runners are expected this year and the event is expected to gross about 5 million 
in cash and services to break even.  The event lacks some of the superstars who race in 
Boston, New York and London.  Big-name runners want to be paid a lot and marathon 
commissioners refuse to spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner. 
The event may surpass New York in numbers of participants next year.</SUM>

Tour companies are organizing international trips for individuals and families who want 
to incorporate running into their vacations.  The tours are geared to those who want to run 
in a marathon and last year one tour operator took 5,500 people to tours to 20 countries 
from Bermuda to Moscow.  Runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races, such 
as the London Marathon, which is the world's largest.  But many marathons also offer 
shorter races ranging from 5 miles to a half-marathon.  Some of the tours also include 
sightseeing, guided runs and fun runs into the trip.</SUM>

The Boston Marathon is becoming a reckless speed duel and the last three have produced 
five of the top 10 times in the race's history.  They also have resulted in a race of 
attrition, with many of the early speedsters faltering in the late stages.  Last year's 
winner, Gelindo Bordin, ran a patient, calculating race, passing thee race leaders at the 21 
mile mark and winning in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, the second fastest time in the 
race's history.  Foremost among the women entrants is Ingrid Kristiansen, who holds   
the world record of 2:21:06 and who won in Boston in 1986 and 1989.</SUM>

The San Francisco marathon is attracting many highly ranked women runners this year.  
The women who didn't need any coaxing to participate in the event are looking toward 
the Olympic trials, scheduled for January.  Most of the U.S. topped ranked women want 
to run in a summer-time marathon and San Francisco has a challenging course.  In 
addition its cool summer temperatures make it one of the few places where you can have 
a marathon in the middle of the summer.  All seven of the highly ranked women runners
