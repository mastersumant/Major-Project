We may never know the number of people killed in and around Tiananmen Square. The 
government said that 300 soldiers, "thugs", and bystanders were killed. Other estimates 
on Saturday and Sunday. Estimates of death range all the way up to 12,000.To most that 
figure seems too high, but the government figure is too low, and the government will not 
provide further details.

Beijing University students say that 150 fellow students are missing. There are rumors 
that troops burned the bodies of demonstrators who were killed while huddling around

for a memorial service honoring the demonstrators killed last weekend in Tiananmen 
Square. The crowd wave banners and wore buttons honoring "the martyrs of Tiananmen 
Square". After the service and speeches, the crowd, led by a casket and Chinese funeral
