Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed 
launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today 
for a May flight. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m. The ship's 
five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after 
the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic 
power steering unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're off and running," NASA spokesman George Diller said. "We're still 80% go 
for launch weather-wise." 
</P>
<P>
With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia 
for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on 
the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on 
a pad 1.7 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today. 
Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the 
Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch. 
</P>
<P>
Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. 
Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch 
the telescope Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery's replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired 
Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, 
one day ahead of schedule.
