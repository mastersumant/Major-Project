<P>
Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this 
small, oil-rich kingdom. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and 
government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in 
the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities. He 
appealed for U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!" a Kuwaiti government official shouted 
in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that 
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the 
request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established "the 
provisional government of free Kuwait." Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the 
coup report a farce. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, 
depending on how quickly the situation stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by 
Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area. Saddam 
also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC production quotas, thus driving down the 
price of oil, a major Iraqi revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the 
border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another 
and taken over its government. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight years of war 
with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after 
crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn. Witnesses said the bombardment of 
ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious. 
</P>
<P>
The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al 
Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy 
artillery barrages. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, was 
killed while trying to defend the palace. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring American 
Embassy, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The al Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years. The Kuwaiti 
ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Operating from an unknown location, al Ahmed's government responded to the 
formation of the provisional government by stating: "Kuwait is Kuwait to its 
people, led by the emir, Sheik Jabbar, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad. God 
preserve them from all harm." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the provisional government announced through Baghdad's official 
Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving Parliament and would hold "free and 
honest elections" at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.
