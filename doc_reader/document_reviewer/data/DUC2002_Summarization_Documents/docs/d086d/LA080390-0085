President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in 
the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops 
to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders. 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo bars imports of oil from Iraq, which account for 3% to 4% of 
total U.S. oil supplies, officials said. The move also prohibits Iraq from 
buying U.S. grain and other foodstuffs, which represent the other chief element 
of trade between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's "naked aggression" against Kuwait has created "an emergency in the 
Persian Gulf," Bush said in a speech to the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit 
organization that focuses on global issues. The United States, he said, would 
insist on "immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bush declared: "We find his 
behavior intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to 
Iraq's massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor, but it 
stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate Kuwait 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Bush Administration sources, the Pentagon stepped up air 
patrols in the Persian Gulf and began moving warships, equipment and supplies 
into the area in a signal to Iraq that the United States would act to halt 
further aggression. 
</P>
<P>
A second executive order signed by the President early Thursday froze Kuwait's 
assets in the United States, a step taken to prevent Iraq from seizing Kuwaiti 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect our friends to stand by us in our time of need," Kuwait's ambassador 
to the United States, Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah, said at a Washington news 
conference. "I think the U.S. intervention at this stage is both paramount and 
important." 
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed al Mashat, said Iraq had 
invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's "interim free 
government." He warned the West not to consider "any foreign interference in 
the current events." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's explanation was quickly denounced by the State Department, which said 
Baghdad's claim that its troops moved into Kuwait at that country's request is 
"patent fraud." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the State Department confirmed that invading Iraqi 
troops had rounded up six American oil field workers near the border of Kuwait. 
Their whereabouts is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's refusal to rule out military action, it appeared an unlikely 
option given the strength of Iraq's military, the limited U.S. forces in the 
region and the opposition to U.S. intervention from other countries in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Bush Administration's energies are focused mainly on 
organizing international economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq. Even 
so, the strongest economic weapon, an international ban on Iraqi oil exports, 
also appears unlikely to be employed. 
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who 
is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on Sunday, Bush 
said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf 
situation with Soviet officials in Moscow today. 
</P>
<P>
In Ulan Bator, Mongolia, where Baker was on an Asian visit, a Baker spokeswoman 
said that the United States and the Soviet Union plan to issue a joint 
statement later today condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on a brief 
refueling stop in Moscow. The meeting was arranged after Baker met with the 
Soviet ambassador to Mongolia, who described the Kremlin's plans for a strong 
Soviet stand on the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, at a news conference in Ulan Bator early today, said there have been no 
reports of U.S casualties in Kuwait and that "the integrity of foreign 
embassies seems to have been preserved so far." 
</P>
<P>
He said the estimate of the number of Iraqi troops in Kuwait varies from 50,000 
to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew to Colorado after meeting early in the morning with his National 
Security Council to discuss the Persian Gulf situation. Originally, the 
President had planned to spend the night in Colorado and return to Washington 
today. Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the capital Thursday morning, Bush told reporters at the White 
House that he was "not contemplating" any U.S. military involvement. 
</P>
<P>
But later in the day, at the news conference with Thatcher, Bush moved away 
from that pledge. He said that he had met during the day with top defense 
advisers and "we're not ruling any options out." 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo imposed by Bush would cut off all commerce with Iraq, except 
news reporting, exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief 
supplies of food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bush, Thatcher has frozen Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, but she has not 
imposed a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and 
considerable national debt. But Europe and Japan are far more dependent on 
Middle Eastern oil than is the United States, and an international oil embargo 
on Iraq would be painful for many U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
At the joint news conference, Thatcher called for U.N. actions to impose 
additional trade sanctions against Iraq. Asked about an oil embargo, however, 
she stopped short. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to support in the (U.N.) Security Council those measures which 
collectively we can agree to and which collectively we can make effective," she 
said. "Those are the two tests." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent the day discussing the Iraqi invasion with senior advisers and other 
heads of state, including the heads of Egypt, Yemen and Jordan, Arab leaders 
whom the President described as "friends of the United States." The Arab 
leaders, Bush said, had appealed to him for "restraint" and "a short period of 
time" in which to develop an "Arab solution." 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed sympathy with the Arab effort but added that "I made clear to 
them that it had gone beyond simply a regional dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, the White House said that Bush had spoken with King Fahd of 
Saudi Arabia for about 30 minutes. The statement said the two leaders agreed 
that the invasion was "unacceptable" and "discussed possible options for 
dealing with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Washington, Kuwaiti ambassador Saud appealed to the 
United States for military assistance. "My people are suffering," Saud said, 
adding that Kuwait is requesting aid "from everyone who has conscience and fair 
play around this world." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kuwait's request for U.S. military intervention, he said: "We 
don't stand a chance if we don't get aid from our friends." 
</P>
<P>
Mashat, Baghdad's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement given to 
reporters in Washington that Iraq hoped to withdraw its forces within a few 
days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The events currently occurring in Kuwait are an internal affair with which 
Iraq has no relation," Mashat said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States asked Iraq to account for the six missing American 
oil company employees in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Maura Reynolds, Michael Ross and Don Shannon, in 
Washington, and Jim Mann, in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, contributed to this story.
