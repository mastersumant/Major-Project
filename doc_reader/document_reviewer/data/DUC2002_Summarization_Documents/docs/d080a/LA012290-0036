A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying 
his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the 
"extreme stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils 
claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the 
congregation during his sermon that, "after much prayer and consultation," he 
realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and 
vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial 
in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and 
Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the 
Manhattan Beach school. The jurors deadlocked on 13 other counts. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the case continues to divide and haunt the South Bay communities 
where it was centered. 
</P>
<P>
St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any 
other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupil's allegation 
during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students 
had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar 
of St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
When the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media, 
other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church. Though 
investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no 
trace of blood, attendance dropped drastically at the church and the church-run 
preschool, which closed soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations never died, despite the passage of time and the announcement by 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to 
support the children's claims. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically over the years, Eales said, he would receive threatening phone 
calls at the church and rectory, and the harassment increased as the McMartin 
case began to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in December, the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten 
eggs. In a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack, the 
vandals, who identified themselves as "the Beach Cities' Conscience," warned 
that "there is simply no place for Satan worship in this town." 
</P>
<P>
The harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after Christmas of a youth 
counselor at the church, who was charged with molesting two teen-age boys he 
had met through his work at St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The counselor, it turned out, was a convicted child molester who had been 
brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor 
who was hired after the McMartin case broke. Then, just days after that 
assistant pastor resigned, the McMartin verdict came down, and, according to 
several church members, the anonymous phone calls returned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a violin string -- you can only tighten it so far and then 
it snaps," Eales said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Though at 61 Eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his 
retirement, he said his doctors told him that "the kind of stress you have been 
under kills." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, he said, he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled 
to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the 
10-year tenure that was his goal when he came to St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
His decision shocked and saddened parishioners, who credited Eales with 
shepherding the church through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron Russell, a 16-year member of the congregation: 
</P>
<P>
"We brought a good, strong man in here, and -- well, this has ruined him."
