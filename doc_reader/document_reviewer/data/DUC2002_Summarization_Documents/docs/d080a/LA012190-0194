Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV. Abby Mann watched, 
listened -- and saw the makings of a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one 
of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case. In that 1986 
interview, Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against 
her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, 
Mann recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer, recognized a theme 
he had tapped before: the hysteria of a witch hunt. Soon, Mann became a 
controversial figure in the case itself -- but he got the inside track on movie 
and book deals. And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin 
Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy, at least, 
from his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
But Mann and his wife, Myra, who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for 
Random House and say they are close to finishing a screenplay, aren't expected 
to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old McMartin case -- or the 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other books are planned, and at least one prominent television 
movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project. That 
producer, who requested anonymity, said he is certain other producers are 
considering projects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a TV thing," one agent said. "Just one of those perfect, 
high-concept, lurid television M-O-Ws" -- an acronym for movies-of-the-week. 
"The producer chases down participants, gets rights -- and then it's an easy 
sale to networks." 
</P>
<P>
Not that easy, network executives say. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment -- the Stuart murder case 
in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first 
docudrama -- McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems. The jury's 
deadlock on 13 counts creates an ambiguity: Is Ray Buckey a villain or a 
victim? 
</P>
<P>
"None of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story," predicted Steven 
White, an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC 
and ABC. "First, the man is still accused of 13 crimes. . . . If I were sitting 
in my old job, I wouldn't touch this thing with a 10-foot pole." 
</P>
<P>
"It raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to 
be looked at with a microscope," said Larry Strichman, a senior executive in 
movie development at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the story you want to tell? Is it a story of justice done or justice 
denied? And it's real unclear at the moment what the answer to that question 
is. Unlike a documentary, it's hard to take an ambiguous position in a 
docudrama." 
</P>
<P>
Producers think network qualms can be overcome, however. One pointed out that 
the Billionaire Boys Club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials 
regarding the slayings were over. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no rules," the producer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's role in the McMartin case came to prominence early. Not long after 
the first allegations of child molestation six years ago, several producers 
pitched projects to networks. Though no explicit McMartin story was produced, 
child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject. One CBS fictional movie 
last year -- "Did You Know the Muffin Man?" -- featured a preschool and satanic 
child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, whose writing credits include the Academy Award-winning "Judgment at 
Nuremberg" in 1961, won an Emmy for "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," a three-hour 
"Kojak" drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted 
of the killings of two white women. The prosecutors, the media and the 
community seemed blinded by hysteria, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining the confidence of the McMartin defendants, the Manns were ultimately 
hired as "investigators" by the defense. That and their earlier alliance with 
former prosecutor Glenn Stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child 
molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who said he had asked to be removed from the McMartin trial team in 
October, 1985, said he and Mann agreed in March, 1986, to produce a book and 
movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become 
public after the trial and appeals were over. But in late 1986, Mann released 
interviews with Stevens in which Stevens said he doubted the defendants' guilt. 
Mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict, which would 
improve the value of Mann's movie deal. But Stevens and the Manns have said 
their ambition from the start has been to get the truth out. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other perspectives may reach the bookstores. Ray Buckey's lawyer, 
Danny Davis, and writer Gordon Dillow, former columnist for the defunct Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner, have a book proposal that is being pitched to a 
variety of publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Lois Timnick, who covered the case from its early stages 
through the trial, also is planning a book. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said his script isn't a courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a trial movie. It's what happens to human beings. I intend to be fair 
to the parents. I don't mean to be vindicative. . . . For the most part, I have 
great sympathy for the parents."
