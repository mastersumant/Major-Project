Well, it did turn out to be "Rain Man's" evening, but not until the last few 
minutes, and if there was a message in Wednesday night's Academy Awards 
results, it's that parity has returned to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For two-thirds of the show, the academy voters seemed determined to give an 
award to every film nominated. As it was, 10 different movies split 17 awards, 
the most winners for one year in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
The major awards made the forecasters look smart and the academy predictable. 
"Rain Man" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and "Mississippi 
Burning," with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its 
highly publicized historical muddling. 
</P>
<P>
But gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many 
recent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving 
people out of the Oscar resale market. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man," its director Barry Levinson, Hoffman and the screenwriters (the two 
of several who worked on it) may have fulfilled their roles as favorites, but 
there were no sure things elsewhere, and people looking for early patterns had 
to throw away the form. 
</P>
<P>
The final score shows "Rain Man" with four Oscars and "Dangerous Liaisons" and 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" with three each. But there were seven other films 
with one award each. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the spread represents a change in voting habits, or an absence of a 
film to rally around, it made for a great show and in some cases, the awards 
helped right some wrongs in the nominations process. 
</P>
<P>
That "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" won three of the six awards for which it was 
nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 
film sure to be regarded as a classic. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films 
that were not box-office hits. The voters tend to favor those films that are 
both of substance and commercially successful (thus: "Rain Man"), and whether 
they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned. 
</P>
<P>
This year, several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers 
at the box office: Jodie Foster as best actress from "The Accused," Geena Davis 
as best supporting actress from "The Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
More surprising were the awards given to "Bird" and "The Milagro Beanfield 
War," films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store 
looking for alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Both films were flawed, but the sound editing done for "Bird," which seamlessly 
blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary 
musicians, was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won. 
</P>
<P>
David Grusin's Oscar for scoring "The Milagro Beanfield War" overcame even 
bigger odds, winning over popular John Williams' score for "The Accidental 
Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
The selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film 
industry had, and whether the spread is a quirk, one can hope it suggests a 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 slate of films was, on total, a marked improvement over recent years. 
The industry is still adjusting to its changing -- its older and more demanding 
audience -- and that means a wider variety of films. Nominees this year 
represented as wide a range of material as any in years, and they produced more 
winning films. 
</P>
<P>
The events last night played hell with the office pool, but it made for a 
better show. Maybe it's the start of something new.
