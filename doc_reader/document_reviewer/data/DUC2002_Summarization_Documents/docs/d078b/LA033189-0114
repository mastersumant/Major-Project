Who would have thought that Snow White, of all people, would become the source 
of Oscar night's only major glitch? 
</P>
<P>
The Walt Disney Co. filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright 
infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
The famous fairy tale character, portrayed by singer-dancer Eileen Bowman, 
opened Wednesday night's Academy Awards ceremonies with an elaborate, 10-minute 
song-and-dance routine. But Disney contends that the character was used on the 
show without the company's permission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have great respect for the academy and for all that it does," Frank Wells, 
Disney's president and chief operating officer, said Thursday in a prepared 
statement. "We were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed 
last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to see that our Snow White character 
had been used extensively without our permission." 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to 
publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character, which debuted in 
a 1937 full-length cartoon film. 
</P>
<P>
"If such a statement had been agreed to by the academy," Wells said, "we would 
have considered the matter ended. For its own reasons, however, the academy 
unfortunately did not accede to our request." 
</P>
<P>
Disney spokesman Erwin Okun did not provide any details of Thursday's 
negotiations with academy officials over an apology, except to say that the 
academy's offer "was not to our satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Davis, the academy's executive administrator, declined comment, saying 
top officials needed time to assess the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't gotten any official notification of this," Davis said, adding that 
he learned of the legal action from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the academy is extremely protective of the Oscar name and statuette 
copyrights and is quick to object to the image's unauthorized use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number Kept Secret 
</P>
<P>
Alan Carr, who produced the Oscar show, had ordered that the details of the 
opening number be kept secret until Wednesday night's ABC telecast. 
</P>
<P>
But in its suit, Disney says a company representative learned of the plans 
early in the week. The company claims that the academy refused to respond to 
its inquiries until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, "through a legal 
representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any 
material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the 
academy's intention to feature Disney's Snow White." 
</P>
<P>
Carr could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Snow White character -- as portrayed Wednesday night by Bowman -- was 
created by Steve Silver, who for 15 years has used the character in the San 
Francisco musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon." 
</P>
<P>
Disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy 
its characters, particularly in consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
"We sue all the time," Okun said. 
</P>
<P>
But Okun said the company, which won four Oscars Wednesday night, has never 
sued Silver over his use of the Snow White character in that production. The 
spokesman, however, did not preclude the possibility of a future lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at these characters as the heart and soul of the company," Okun 
explained.
