British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in 
negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry 
speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily 
News or the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of each of those newspapers denied that they were negotiating with 
Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of 
Maxwell's Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for 
Maxwell Communications, the investor's London-based holding company. The 
spokesman declined to elaborate on the remarks, and said Maxwell had left the 
United States.

<P>
The Daily News has one of the United States' largest circulations, but in 
recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation 
in a market with three other dailies. The paper is conducting difficult labor 
contract negotiations with its unions. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA 
Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his 
month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country. 
Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about 
printing the paper for U.S. distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Other industry officials conjectured that Maxwell might be talking to the 
Chicago Sun-Times, which has seen daily circulation slide more than 100,000 
papers, to about 533,000, since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, recently bought three U.S. 
supermarket tabloids, the Globe, National Examiner and the Sun, for an 
estimated $100 million.
