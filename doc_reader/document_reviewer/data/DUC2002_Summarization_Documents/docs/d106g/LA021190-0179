World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R. 
Mandela's impending release from prison, and international rejoicing began to 
build for an event so long awaited by so many. 
</P>
<P>
Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South 
Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure 
on the white-led government. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush praised South African President Frederik W. de Klerk for "bold 
and imaginative leadership," and the Canadian government expressed delight at 
the announcement that Mandela would be released today. 
</P>
<P>
In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge 
for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African National Congress, said his 
first reaction was to kneel down and thank God. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put 
their heads together and build on these developments," Kaunda said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the announcement of Mandela's release date, the ANC's leadership 
announced from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia: "We welcome Nelson Mandela 
back from all those years of imprisonment into our midst with great joy." 
</P>
<P>
"Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last," said Charles Haughey, 
Irish prime minister and current president of the European Community, which has 
been using economic sanctions to pressure Pretoria to give up apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"By his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that the human 
spirit can never be vanquished," Haughey said. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, current chairman of the Organization of 
African Unity, sent Mandela a message of congratulation, praising the 
"sacrifices of the great people of South Africa" and assuring him of Egyptian 
solidarity with his cause. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, Moscow Radio broadcast news of the announcement, then 
added: "Nelson Mandela has become the world's most famous political prisoner, 
put in jail for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square was temporarily rechristened Nelson 
Mandela Square. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a jubilant crowd of about 120, some waving pictures of Mandela, 
celebrated in the pouring rain outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by her 10 Downing St. office, Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher said, "We believe that the steps President de Klerk has taken merit a 
positive, practical response." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new investment in South 
Africa -- a restraint which in our case in any event has been voluntary -- and 
we shall be discussing this with our EC partners," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the European Community banned imports of South African iron, steel and 
Kruggerand gold coins, and barred new investment in the country. It had already 
frozen scientific and cultural relations. 
</P>
<P>
Britain regards the iron, steel and coin embargoes as mandatory, but not the 
investment ban, and has already announced that it is no longer observing the 
scientific and cultural embargo. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said he was 
delighted at the news, which he called "a tremendous victory for the people of 
South Africa and for the international sanctions campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary General Shridath Ramphal said Mandela's safety must be 
guaranteed by the South African government and that until change there becomes 
irreversible, the Commonwealth will sustain its pressure for the end of 
apartheid. "It is not yet time to demobilize the international support for 
apartheid's victims," he said.
