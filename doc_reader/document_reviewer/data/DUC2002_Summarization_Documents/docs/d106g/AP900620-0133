   The arrival Wednesday of African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela prompted an outpouring of praise and
encouragement from politicians and supporters. A sampling of their
comments:

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson: ``The presence of Nelson Mandela
generates hope around the world. He emerged from the prison
unbroken, unbowed and without bitterness, and he continues to
struggle for human rights. Just as the walls came down in Berlin,
they should come down in South Africa as well.''

   Mayor David Dinkins: ``Our honored guest ... is a George
Washington, a Bolivar, a King, a Herzl. He is like a modern-day
Moses leading the people of South Africa from enslavement at the
hands of the pharaohs. He and his people have endured their walk
through the desert of deprivation. And now, his path is clear. He
will not be deterred. He and his people have suffered their way
into the leadership of South Africa.''

   Former tennis star Arthur Ashe: ``For me, one of my fondest
dreams and hopes is to see Nelson Mandela free. I never thought I'd
see the day. I feel humbled by being part of his welcome to our
country. He will do more good here than he will ever, ever know.''

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo: ``Today we are celebrating Nelson
Mandela and honoring his commitment to mankind. This government
ought to continue to support the needs of South Africa with its
speeches, its prayers and its money.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio: ``Today is a restatement of our
commitment that all people are created equal.''
