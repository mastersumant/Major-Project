   A man fired several dozen shots from an
automatic rifle in an elementary school Tuesday, killing six
children, wounding at least 35 other people and then shooting
himself in the head, authorities said.
   ``We have at least one suspect in custody who has a gunshot wound
to the head,'' Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said.
   Bruce Fernandez, spokesman for the county office of emergency
services, said six people had died.
   Ellen Rich at St. Joseph's Medical Center said eight victims were
being treated there, and said the total, including those being
treated at other hospitals, was 35 wounded.
   ``We have at least 30 people that we've sent out to area
hospitals,'' said Police Chief Jack Calkins.
   The attack at Cleveland Elementary School came shortly before
noon. Other children were kept in their rooms, said John Klose,
Stockton Unified School District information officer.
   Police Sgt. James Monk said his office learned that a ``man went
berserk with an automatic weapon and we have several (people) down.''
   ``Several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle,'' said
Monk.
