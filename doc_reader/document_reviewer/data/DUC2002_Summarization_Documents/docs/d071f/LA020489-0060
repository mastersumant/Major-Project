More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at 
Sunday's All Breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena. For families who are thinking about getting a dog, this is a chance to 
size up the possibilities and talk with pet owners about the advantages and 
disadvantages of different breeds.

<P>
Around the arena, owners will be busy grooming and cajoling their charges into 
center-ring readiness.

<P>
Between judgings, a troupe of Dobermans will jump through hoops and barrels and 
will scale walls. In the scent relay, teams of dogs will jump over hurdles and 
locate the jackets of their owners. There will also be a demonstration of how 
dogs herd farm animals.

<P>
Other attractions include the appearance of Warren Eckstein, radio host of "Pet 
Show," who will answer behavioral questions about dogs (as well as cats, pigs 
and goldfish, if he's asked); free veterinary advice; a demonstration of how 
4-H youngsters help train puppies to become guide dogs, and more than 70 
vendors selling dog paraphernalia. A computer is provided for visitors' use to 
find out which breeds would best suit their life styles.

<P>
Show hours are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: adults, $4.50; children, $1. 
Information: (818) 789-8350.
