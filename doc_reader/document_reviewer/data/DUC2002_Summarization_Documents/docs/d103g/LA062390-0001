Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call 
from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of 
Rasht, Iran, with her family. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was watching the World Cup," 
Nyakoui recalls. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 minutes after she hung up, Rasht and other cities in Iran's northern 
region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in San Diego, it was several hours before Nyakoui even heard news of 
the quake. When he did, some quick time-zone arithmetic showed that he had 
talked to his wife just minutes before the quake happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very worried," Nyakoui said. "I tried through the Red Cross to call 
Iran, but they told us they couldn't do anything before 48 hours passed." 
</P>
<P>
One of about 25,000 San Diego Iranians in the same anxious state, Nyakoui was 
luckier than most: His wife managed to call him a second time that day, about 
eight hours after the quake, to tell him she and their two children were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Phone lines remained jammed Friday, other Iranian-Americans in San Diego said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of panic. It's just impossible to get through," said Houshang 
Ghashghai, who teaches political science at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Already though, some of the worried immigrants were turning their fear into 
action by mobilizing relief efforts for Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Hamid Biglari, a theoretical physicist at UC San Diego, was among those who 
organized a local group to gather contributions for the United Nations Fund for 
the Iran Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The group has set up two offices and phone lines. They are collecting medicine, 
food and a variety of living supplies, including blankets, light clothing and 
flashlights. The supplies will be transported by the United Nations, Biglari 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another group gathering medical supplies is Southwest Medical Teams, an 
organization whose last major international effort was sending volunteers and 
medical supplies to Armenia after the 1988 quake there. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Medical Teams won't be sending any volunteers this time, said 
director Barry La Forgia. 
</P>
<P>
"That's at the advice of the State Department. They couldn't ensure our safety 
over there, and we don't want to endanger any of our volunteers," La Forgia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
