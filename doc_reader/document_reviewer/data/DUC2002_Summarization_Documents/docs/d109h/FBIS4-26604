  [Text] Guangzhou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The highest flood 
peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, said Zhu 
Senlin, governor of south China's Guangdong Province. 
  While inspecting flood control and relief work in Qingyuan 
city on the Beijiang River yesterday, he attributed Guangdong's 
success in combating this flood -- almost the biggest in 100 
years -- to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in 
Guangdong and local residents. 
  More than 200 people lost their lives in the natural 
disaster, which destroyed 189,000 rooms and ruined crops on 1.2 
million hectares. 
  The flood was caused by successive torrential rainstorms in 
the Xijiang and Beijiang River valleys in early and middle June. 
Major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded 
their highest water levels, all four meters above the danger 
mark. 
  Local governments at various levels in the province have 
paid 
close attention to flood control work, and leading government 
and communist party officials of different localities have gone 
to the flood-fighting front. 
  No breaches of major embankments or reservoirs were reported 
despite the most serious flood in a hundred years, effectively 
protecting the safety of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, and 
the Pearl (Zhujiang) River Delta. 
  But the losses caused by the flood were quite serious, said 
the governor. 
  According to him, 11 million people in the province's nine 
cities and 55 counties were affected, and more than 200 people 
died in the natural disaster, with 189,000 rooms destroyed and 
1.2 million hectares of crops ruined. The direct economic 
losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan. 
  The governor warned that though the flood danger had 
receded, 
the determination to fight possible further floods could not 
slacken, as this is just the beginning: the main flood season, 
which usually begins in late July and early August, has not yet 
arrived. 
  He urged local officials to be on constant alert against 
further possible floods and be meticulous about flood prevention 
and control measures, while doing their utmost to help flood 
victims, assisting them to resume production as soon as possible 
and maintaining social stability.
