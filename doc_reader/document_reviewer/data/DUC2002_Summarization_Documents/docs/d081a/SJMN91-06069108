<LEADPARA>  A one-day strike by coal miners in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has grown into a
nationwide walkout involving up to 100,000 miners demanding President Mikhail
Gorbachev surrender power to the restive republics, a union leader said
Friday.;    "The government doesn't want to negotiate with us. They understand
that we're not like the phony unions they had before," said Pavel Shushpanov,
chairman of the executive committee of the 5-month-old Independent Union of
Miners.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners are still working, but output
in some key regions has been halved, saddling Gorbachev with a substantial
labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the Soviet economy.;   
The strike is the new union's first major test of strength. It began March 1
as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and the
Krasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's
major coal regions.;    The strikers are seeking wage increases of at least
100 percent, better working conditions and earlier retirement. They claim the
government has not kept promises it made to raise miners' living standards as
settlement of a nationwide coal strike in July 1989.;    The 1989 strike,
which involved more than 500,000 miners, made only economic demands. This
time, Shushpanov said, the miners also want three major political
concessions.;    First, he said, they want "real sovereignty" for the 15
Soviet republics. They are unhappy with Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty,
which would leave the central government in control of the economy, defense,
foreign policy and communications, he said.;    Second, the union is demanding
more power for Gorbachev's Federation Council, which includes the presidents
of all the republics.;    Finally, the union wants a "law on property" that
would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of
land and industry, including some mines, he said.;    According to the state
news agency Tass, the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of the
Ukraine, the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia, and the Kuznetsk
coal basin of western Siberia.  </TEXT>
