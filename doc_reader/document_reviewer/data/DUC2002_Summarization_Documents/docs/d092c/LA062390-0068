Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private 
humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other 
relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies 
to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1,000 hard hats, 
1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 
500 tents. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military, which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in 
need, stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any U.S. 
aid requested by Iran. However, a Pentagon official said it is unlikely that 
the State Department and the White House would authorize a military airlift of 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear that the Iranians don't want us, and there are so many 
alternatives, such as private charters, it really isn't necessary," the 
officials said. "In a case like this, we would really be more of an irritant 
than a help." 
</P>
<P>
The quake, which rocked the northern region of Iran early Thursday, left nearly 
29,000 dead, by official count, and about 400,000 homeless. The death toll is 
expected to rise, however, as rescuers continue work. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international 
humanitarian organizations. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who toured 
the stricken region Friday, also appealed for international aid. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Davis, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington, said Friday 
that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped, the large 
number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit 
international assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit 
money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked 
donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red 
Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish relief organizations found themselves in an uncomfortable position 
because of Iran's hostility toward the United States and Israel. Confronted 
with reports that Iran would not welcome assistance from Israel, the groups 
were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said 
directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call 
Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims. 
</P>
<P>
After a spirited discussion, the group decided to help but to monitor the 
situation closely and to be prepared to change their decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a humanitarian organization . . . without regard to political 
considerations," Griffel said. "But if they are going politicize it, we will 
definitely reconsider our participation." 
</P>
<P>
Amir Zamani, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, 
welcomed the "many offers from many organizations" that his office has 
received. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran needs assistance, and such organizations are welcome to send it." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging Iran's strained relations with many nations, Zamani said his 
country is attempting to ease the antagonism to deal with the disaster in the 
country. As an example, he said "no formalities" will be required for relief 
planes flying into Iran. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that aid shipments will be coordinated by the government and 
routed through Tehran because there are no other airports in the country that 
can accommodate large transport planes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other U.S. groups were rushing to supply Iran with emergency goods. 
</P>
<P>
Dwain Schenck, a relief worker for AmeriCares Foundation, said the 
Connecticut-based relief group expects to send 80,000 pounds of medical 
supplies, two doctors, a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to Iran 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be there about four days or so," he said.
