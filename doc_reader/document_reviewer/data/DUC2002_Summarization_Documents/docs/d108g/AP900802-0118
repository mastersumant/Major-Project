   ``The Iraqi government firmly believes and states that Iraq is
pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations
with Kuwait. Furthermore, it is the Kuwaitis themselves who will
determine their own future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon
as order has been restored.'' _ Sabah Talat Kadrat, Iraq's deputy
permanent representative to the United Nations.

   ``The pretext to invade an independent, sovereign state is a
false, flimsy pretext. This kind of pretext, if it's not going to
be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august assembly, all
international relations will be threatened. No country at all will
be safe after this.'' _ Mohammad Abulhasan, Kuwait's ambassador to
the United Nations.

   ``We remain committed to take whatever actions are necessary to
defend our longstanding, vital interests in the (Persian) Gulf.'' _
President Bush, who said his advisers would ``consider all possible
options available to us.''
