<LEADPARA>  Mikhail Gorbachev urged all sides Tuesday to take their time in deciding the
fate of Erich Honecker, as the fugitive former East German leader spent a
seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean Embassy.;   A day after the Russian
government backed down from its threat to expel him, diplomats sought to
settle the fate of the 79-year-old Honecker.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted
to flee to the West during his years in power. But speculation lingers that
German politicians have little real interest in trying a man who may possess
embarrassing secrets.;   "Let's forget about the issue of Erich Honecker for
several days. Let's hope this special issue will be resolved," Gorbachev's
spokesman, Andrei Grachev, quoted the Soviet president as telling German
media.;   But Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying he did not exclude the
possibility that Honecker would leave Russia for North Korea in the next few
days.;   Gorbachev had served as Honecker's protector until the Soviet
leader's political fortunes declined. Last week Russia abruptly ordered
Honecker to leave the country or face expulsion.;   North Korean and Russian
diplomats confirmed that talks were held Tuesday about a North Korean offer
for Honecker to travel to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for medical
treatment.;   Li Cher Gvan, a consul at the North Korean Embassy, said a
commercial North Korean airliner remained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport
ready to fly Honecker to Pyongyang. But he said his country was still awaiting
a positive reply from the Russian government on the offer to accept Honecker.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had not yet formulated a response.;  
Outside the Chilean Embassy, several dozen demonstrators continued their
vigil, demanding humane treatment for Honecker.  </TEXT>
