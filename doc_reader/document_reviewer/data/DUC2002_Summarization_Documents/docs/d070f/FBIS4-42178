  [Text] Berlin -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of 
state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday morning 
[29 May], according to his lawyer. Lawyer Nicolas Becker, who 
had represented 81-year-old Honecker before the Berlin court in 
1992 and early 1993, told DPA on Sunday afternoon that Honecker 
had rejected an operation. However, everything that was 
sensible had been done with regard to his cancer. 
  Becker could not comment on the exact cause of Honecker's 
death. His colleague, Wolfgang Ziegler, had said earlier that 
the former most powerful man in the GDR had obviously died from 
his liver cancer. 
  Becker said he did not know whether Honecker has left a will 
or where the funeral would be held. This will be decided by the 
family. 
  He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had 
informed Becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay 
in Chile. After being released from prison in 1993, Honecker 
had traveled to Santiago to join his daughter, who is married to 
a Chilean. Since then, he and his wife had been living in a 
house in a wealthy Santiago area.
