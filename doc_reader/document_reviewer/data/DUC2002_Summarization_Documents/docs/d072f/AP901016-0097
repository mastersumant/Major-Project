   Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents
and flamboyant personality helped make him the first American
maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today
alongside his wife.
   Bernstein, who died of lung failure Sunday at age 72, was buried
this afternoon in private ceremonies at Greenwood Cemetery in
Brooklyn. His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
   Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic
performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first
American-born music director. Bernstein was appointed in 1958 and
stepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.
   The Philharmonic will perform an all-Bernstein program beginning
Thursday and continuing through Oct. 23. The schedule had called
for works by Shostakovich and Beethoven.
   A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14,
the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.
   Famed for his gymnastics at the podium, Bernstein composed
symphonies as well as movie scores and Broadway shows such as
``West Side Story,'' ``On the Town'' and ``Candide.''
   His Emmy-winning ``Young People's Concerts'' on television
introduced thousands to classical music.
   ``He was the most unique musician of this century, there is no
doubt about it,'' said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York
Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
   Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of ``West
Side Story,'' said Bernstein himself played the piano for him
during rehearsals.
   ``He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared too
much,'' Kert said. ``I was the new kid on the block and he stroked
me and took care of me - and I will never forget him for that.''
