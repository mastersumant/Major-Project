In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning 
special remembrances. Sunday at Royce Hall, the American Youth Symphony has 
added local composer Leon Levitch's Elegy for Strings -- a personal choice from 
conductor Mehli Mehta -- to the program to honor Bernstein, who died last 
Sunday.

<P>
Also, opening the new season of the Glendale Symphony season on Sunday at 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, music director Lalo Schifrin will observe a moment 
of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague.

Last Monday, KUSC-FM (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 
a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and 
compositions of Bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him 
discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
KKGO-FM (105.1) also devoted a considerable amount air time to Bernstein's work 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>

Another measure of grief came from the obituary section of the New York Times, 
which includes a section of special classified ads for public condolences at 
$15.85 a line. The outpouring of emotions following Bernstein's death filled 
almost 200 lines (15 inches of small type) and encompassed 14 separate 
tributes. Among the contributors were conductors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur, as 
well as Peter Martins of the New York Ballet and Christopher Keene of the New 
York City Opera.

"Leonard Bernstein . . . is now being mourned by the entire world. I personally 
have lost a dear friend." wrote Mehta in his tribute. "I was proud to be 
associated with him at the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic 
Orchestra, both of which he considered family." 
</P>
<P>
"This is perhaps not unusual for a prominent member of the Jewish community 
involved with philanthropic activities," reported Irv Horowitz, the New York 
Times obituary editor. He said the biggest similar reaction he could recall 
came after the recent death of the mother of the New York Times publisher. 
"That was considerably larger," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernstein family has requested contributions in lieu of flowers be made to 
the Bernstein Education Through the Arts Fund Inc., 25 C.P.W., Suite 1B, New 
York, N.Y. 10023.
