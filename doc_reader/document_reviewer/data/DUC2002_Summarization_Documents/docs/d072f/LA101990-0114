Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in 
history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death 
on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late 
Bernstein's catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of 
Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up 
timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace. However, 
most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including 
some made early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month -- as originally 
scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon. These 
are recent recordings Bernstein made with the New York Philharmonic 
(Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony), the Vienna Philharmonic (two Mozart symphonies 
and the clarinet concerto) and Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam (Schubert's 
Symphonies Nos. 5 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, 
director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin 
its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs 
of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and 
others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by 
Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD." 
</P>
<P>
At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, 
reported: "We are looking at (Bernstein's) active DG discography, which 
contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"That's 120 titles (of standard classical repertory) and some of Bernstein's 
own (non-theatrical) music, plus another dozen videos." In his last years, 
Bernstein recorded exclusively for DG. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of 
Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. 
Philharmonic. These recordings were made between 1977 and 1985 of music by 
Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Haydn, Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and 
Gershwin. Called "The Bernstein Edition," it is being sold concurrently in 
Europe in a 25-CD set. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Moody, vice president of the classical label, would not reveal sales 
figures for "The Bernstein Edition," but said: "I can say that it is selling 
very well in this country, surprisingly well, given the U.S. market aversion to 
CD sets." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG 
Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a 
March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in 
Copland's "Billy the Kid" and a suite from Bernstein's "On the Town," 
recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first 
commercial recordings. 
</P>
<P>
BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an 
early Bernstein recording as pianist -- in which he plays Copland's Piano 
Variations -- as well as other recorded documents of the young 
composer/pianist. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings 
and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is 
no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette. 
Three tapes of programs recorded in 1971, all on Phoenix/BFA Films and Video, 
are out: 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: a Tribute," featuring Bernstein playing sections of 
Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major. 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: Fidelio," with rehearsal and concert footage of 
Bernstein working with the Vienna State Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: Ode to Joy From the Ninth Symphony," featuring the 
Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Three movies whose scores he composed are also on home video: 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's "On the Town" (1949), co-starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The 
lyrics are by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's "West Side Story" (1961), featuring Stephen Sondheim's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
* RCA/Columbia's "On the Waterfront" (1954), the Oscar-winner for best picture.
