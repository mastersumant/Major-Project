Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees, whom Democrats said had no 
qualifications except political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first 
voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real 
estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial 
nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to 
Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be 
ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's "quite thin" qualifications 
for the job but that he felt he had made an "implicit" commitment to vote for 
the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he 
would oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who led the opposition to the nominations, vowed 
to carry the fight to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"One looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to 
this position," Sarbanes said of Zappala. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is to be found in the appendix, which lists the campaign 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to 
Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years. His prior 
governmental experience, described on the ambassadorial evaluation form 
submitted to the committee, consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance 
committees for President Bush and the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Approvals 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the committee routinely approved the nomination of Shirley 
Temple Black to be ambassador to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the 
Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the 
Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L. Brown to be 
ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real 
estate developer, to be ambassador to Switzerland.
