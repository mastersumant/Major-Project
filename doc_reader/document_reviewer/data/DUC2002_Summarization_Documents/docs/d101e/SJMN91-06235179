<LEADPARA>  A week before the Soviet coup, U.S. intelligence officials warned the White
House of "a real possibility" that hard-liners in the KGB or the Soviet
military might act to block the scheduled signing of the new Union Treaty,
senior government officials said Wednesday, but they acknowledged they knew
too little about such plans to enable President Bush to act.;   The treaty,
which reduces Moscow's centralized control and strengthens powers of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics, is anathema to Soviet conservatives. And U.S.
analysts monitoring Soviet troop movements concluded six months to a year ago
that right-wing officials had started embryonic plans for a coup, the
officials said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     As soon as the hard-liners made their move Sunday night -- two days before
Gorbachev was to sign the treaty -- it was obvious the coup was doomed to
failure, they said.;   One result of the bungled coup is that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev -- even though reinstated as head of state -- "could be
irrelevant" to what happens next, analysts said. Even before Gorbachev
returned to Moscow, they predicted his future would be limited to a figurehead
role.;   "He lost by being peripheral to what happened. No one really came to
Gorbachev's assistance as leader of the country," one U.S. official said.
Instead, opposition to the coup was based on "the illegality of the principle"
of usurping power and widespread fear that if Gorbachev could be "rolled up,"
then other democratically elected leaders could be, too.;   In the aftermath
of the coup, analysts also predicted that:;   (check) Major constraints on
Soviet cooperation with the West, such as the military's disaffection with
Gorbachev's support of Bush's strategy during the Persian Gulf war, will now
be greatly weakened or removed, although "a benign" Soviet Union cannot be
assumed in every case.;   (check) The coup's abrupt end opened the way for
faster democratic reforms, but it will not now "create Jeffersonian democracy
-- or maybe ever.";   (check) The Communist Party is "dead" and will no longer
be a political force, although most of the country's bureaucrats are current
or former party members.;   (check) Gorbachev is likely to abandon the party
and move more aggressively toward reform.  </TEXT>
