A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school 
Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, injuring nearly 300 and trapping many 
others in their cars and homes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and 
shopping areas," said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched 
down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in this northeastern Alabama city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Steve Hettinger said 14 deaths had been confirmed, with 285 people 
injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while city streets 
were filled with rush-hour traffic. 
</P>

Gov. Guy Hunt, at the state's disaster center in Montgomery, said rescue teams 
with cranes and floodlights would search the rubble through the night for 
injured or dead. "It may be tomorrow before we have a final count," he said.

<P>
The governor said 50 National Guard troops were dispatched to the city, along 
with search and rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford 
Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble by 
the tornado. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing left standing was a door frame," news photographer Mike Mercier 
said of the school, which was empty of staff and pupils when the tornado hit. 
Police reported one person killed in a car outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square apartments, 
three at a business school, Southern Junior College, which is located in a 
converted movie theater, and others in scattered areas. 
</P>

"Rescuers are digging in the rubble," state trooper W. L. Kelly said. He said 
two people were killed when the twister hit house trailers in rural areas east 
of Huntsville. The fifth death was reported near the shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
"We've called in troopers from around the state to help," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone 
Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons 
testing center. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the tornadoes and 
WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting, reported widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started 
shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of," said real estate 
broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It started picking cars up and pushing them around . . . some of them upside 
down, some of them just strewn around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy overhead power lines "started snapping just like a circus performer would 
snap his whip," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping 
over the top of us . . . it was as if you were looking into an arc-welder, they 
were so bright," he said. 
</P>
<P>
WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a business collapsed 
from winds that overturned cars in the area. A nearby shopping center also was 
damaged.

reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.

at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of Sylacauga.

much of Alabama and the National Weather Service placed most of the state under 
a tornado watch.
