   Florence Griffith Joyner twice smashed
a world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the
200-meter sprint.
   She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win four
track and field gold medals in a single Olympics.
   Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds,
shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier in
her semifinal heat. In that race, she ran 21.56, eclipsing the
9-year-old mark of 21.71 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germany
and equaled three times since.
   In her 200 quarterfinal heat Wednesday, Griffith Joyner ran an
Olympic record 21.76 seconds.
   Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the
100 meters, had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for the
final 100 meters. She glided to the wire.
   ``I know I can run much faster,'' she said. ``I felt very
relaxed. That's the key.''
   Griffith Joyner, 28, is scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay
Saturday and may compete in the 1,600-meter relay that day.
   Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorful
bodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the
1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. sprinter and long
jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in
1948.
