Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a 
whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the 
cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
CBS estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game, down only 2 
million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
On the upside for CBS -- Super Bowl XXIV carried enough of its audience over to 
the debut of the new series, "Grand Slam," to provide a good audience sampling 
and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night. 
</P>
<P>
It was CBS' bad luck that the game was so predictably lopsided, which resulted 
in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did 
two decades ago. Technically, Super Bowl IV in 1970 out-rated Super Bowl XXIV, 
39.4 to 39.0. But last Sunday's game had almost twice as many viewers as the 
estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat Minnesota 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This also marks only the third time that the network airing the Super Bowl did 
not win the week -- NBC managed it in 1979 and 1981. It also is only the second 
time the Super Bowl network was third for the week -- dating back to NBC in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were not to blame for all of CBS' troubles last week. The network 
tried some stunting, most of which did not work. On Monday it ran a popular 
theatrical movie, "Cocoon," which tied for 54th. The big winner was the 
American Music Awards on ABC, which came in 10th for the week.
