  [Text] Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, trying to brush aside recent differences with 
London, today stressed Washington's special transatlantic 
relationship with Britain. 
  Welcoming British Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh, 
where major's grandfather and father once lived, Clinton said at 
the airport, "We're working together today to respond to the 
terrible tragedy in Bosnia to try to bring an end to the killing 
and to bring peace and to keep that conflict from spreading." 
  For his part, Major said, pressure would be increased for 
the 
peace that every sensitive person wishes to see in that war-torn 
and troubled land. 
  On Russia, Major said "A Russia that's a good neighbor to 
the 
United States and West would be one of the finest things that 
this generation could hand down to the next." 
  Clinton will then share his Air Force One back to the 
nation's capital. 
  Major will spend a night at the White House, the first 
foreign head of state to have this honor since Clinton became 
President. 
  On Tuesday [1 March], the two leaders will begin their 
discussions on a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, 
Northern Ireland and the world trade. 
  The two will also discuss Northern Ireland and "what to do 
with NATO," Clinton said. 
  Clinton and major will meet again in June in Europe during 
the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day of the second 
world war. 
  Major said Clinton would visit Britain, and perhaps the 
Oxford University, Clinton's alma mater, during the June visit.
