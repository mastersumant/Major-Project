The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday 
that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England 
to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously. It would be one 
of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island. 
</P>
<P>
Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged 
dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away. The musicians were 
between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with 
certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb. But he said the 
characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared 
to confirm that it was the work of the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA "active service" 
units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and 
continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
One member, known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth 
novel "The Day of the Jackal," has been eluding the authorities for two years. 
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last 
successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in 
August, 1988. One soldier was killed in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb 
factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in 
pursuit of a car thief. A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons, 
ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a "hit list" of 100 British 
political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines 
School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent. At the 
school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before 
joining Royal Marines bands. 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the 
rubble. Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for 
victims and survivors. Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a 
nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in 
an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode," Heather 
Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn. She said 
she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole window was blown across the kitchen," Hackett recalled. Her 
2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but 
caused no serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I just screamed and ran out of the room," she said. "The bang was so loud I 
thought the whole house was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appalling Outrage' 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Tom King visited the scene and called the bombing "an 
appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen -- people who worked for 
charity, who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country, 
right across the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The real evil of these murders is that the people who commit them, the 
'godfathers' who send them to commit them, know that they will actually achieve 
nothing. Terrorism is not going to win. We shall find the people responsible 
for this outrage sooner or later, as we have already found some of those 
responsible for the earlier outrages, and they will be brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities have been on high alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection 
with last month's 20th anniversary of the introduction of British troops into 
Northern Ireland. The republican underground organization opposes British rule 
in the predominantly Protestant province and is fighting to join the mainly 
Roman Catholic south in a united, independent Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visit to Ulster 
</P>
<P>
But in a statement telephoned to a Dublin news agency, Ireland International, 
Friday's attack was linked to Thatcher's visit last week to units of the 
controversial Ulster Defense Regiment in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The locally recruited, overwhelmingly Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment has 
come under fire in connection with an investigation into the leak of secret 
government lists of suspected IRA members to Protestant assassination squads. 
It is widely hated by the Catholic minority in the province, and the Irish 
government in Dublin has urged Britain to disband the force. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Thatcher visited Ireland with a message of war at a time when we want 
peace," the statement claiming responsibility for the Deal attack said. "Now in 
turn we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent. But we still want peace, and we 
want the British government to leave our country." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed "P. O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau," a 
signature that has appeared on earlier IRA bombing claims. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's attack was the worst on the mainland since the virtually simultaneous 
bombings of July, 1982, directed at ceremonial military units in London's Hyde 
Park and Regent's Park. Eleven bandsmen and mounted guards were killed in those 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Eight persons were killed by IRA car bombs outside Harrods department store 
here in December, 1983, and 21 were killed and 162 injured in two Birmingham 
public house bombings in the fall of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
An attempted barracks bombing was averted last February when a sentry came upon 
two intruders who had managed to get inside a military camp in Shropshire. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a series of bomb and automatic rifle attacks this year on 
British soldiers and their families stationed in West Germany. Earlier this 
month an IRA gunman shot to death an army wife, Heidi Hazell, 25, in her car 
near her home at Dortmund.
