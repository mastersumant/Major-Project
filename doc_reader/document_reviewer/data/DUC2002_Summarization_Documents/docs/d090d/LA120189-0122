As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7,000 miles away, 
supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday 
night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines 
held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express 
sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio 
Honasan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for Mrs. Aquino to step down immediately," said Milo Castelo, 
45, a Los Angeles attorney. He said the Aquino government is "inept and 
incompetent" and guilty of "rampant corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and 
took the elevator to the 12th-floor consulate, where a coalition of four 
Filipino groups in Los Angeles that support the Aquino government had just 
completed a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen television news crews watched as the anti-government protesters 
confronted the acting consul general for the Philippines in Los Angeles, Willy 
C. Gaa. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in sympathy with the coup in the Philippines!" announced Eli Swing, 49, 
a Los Angeles real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
The consul general remained silent, glaring at the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
But Danny Lamila, a representative of the Philippines Liberal Party, loudly 
defended the government. 
</P>
<P>
"These people staging the coup are criminals," Lamila yelled. "They are 
fugitives from justice!" 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, the 20 Aquino supporters in the room began chanting "Cory! 
Cory!" The anti-government protesters then left the consular offices and order 
was restored. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Santillas of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence said he believes 
that most of the estimated 350,000 Filipinos living in Los Angeles County 
oppose the military coup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here not only to support the president, but also the democratic 
institutions," he said. "The military is a dangerous leftover from the 
dictatorship (of Ferdinand Marcos). We don't want the government to be a 
hostage to the military." 
</P>
<P>
Also present at the press conference was Andrea Aquino, 50, the niece of 
assassinated Marcos opponent Benigno Aquino, Cory Aquino's husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I support democracy and the government against the coup," she said. "I think 
it's about time these renegades are punished."
