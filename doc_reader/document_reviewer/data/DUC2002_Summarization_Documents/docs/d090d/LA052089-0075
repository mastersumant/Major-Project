President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not 
permit deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to be buried in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos was reported to be in "very critical condition" in Honolulu, where he 
has lived in exile since his ouster in 1986. Hospital officials there said that 
he rallied slightly Friday but remained in extremely critical condition. The 
71-year-old former president has been suffering from heart, lung and kidney 
disorders as well as pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
His frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis blood-cleansing 
machine, Marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint 
signs of life, doctors in Hawaii said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical sources said that he is being treated with antibiotics and heart 
medication but that he could die at "any time." 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations here broadcast hourly reports on Marcos' condition. Philippine 
officials were asked repeatedly whether the Aquino government's refusal to 
allow Marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death. 
</P>
<P>
One radio station broadcast an interview with Marcos' wife, Imelda, at the St. 
Francis Medical Center in Honolulu, where she was said to be maintaining a 
vigil at his bedside. She was quoted as appealing to Aquino to "open her heart" 
and allow Marcos to return to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said she would not alter her position but that she had prayed for 
Marcos' recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos that as much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his 
rights, I still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions 
of Filipinos," Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
"I have said . . . in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought 
back here, and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incident." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Marcos supporters announced that they will march through the 
capital today to support the former president's demand that he be allowed to 
die in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Despite charges that Marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury 
of billions of dollars, the former president still has a significant following 
here. In the Philippines, personal loyalty is considered a sacred debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempted Coups 
</P>
<P>
Government officials have accused Marcos supporters of taking part in at least 
two attempted coups against the Aquino government. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino evidently is concerned that even after death, the return of Marcos' 
remains could spark violence or galvanize opposition to her government. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's national security adviser, Rafael Ileto, told reporters Friday that 
the Philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the 
death of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that while Marcos is no longer a threat to the 
government, his supporters "can still cause disruption." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' mother, Josefa, died a year ago, but because Marcos has been barred 
from this country, the family refuses to have her remains interred. A newspaper 
advertisement published on the first anniversary of her death May 4 said, 
"funeral arrangements will be announced." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos and his wife have been indicted by a federal grand jury in the United 
States on charges of racketeering, fraud and extortion. Marcos has been excused 
from appearing in court up to now because of his failing health. Imelda Marcos 
is free on $5 million bail.
